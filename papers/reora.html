-- However, Reora movement was a very mighty movement. The Zamindar 
of Reora was a very rich and very cruel person. He was the Chairman of 
the Gaya District Board. His name is Rameshwar Prasad Singh.

 
<P>
He came to our village on his tour from Jahanabad. He was passing 
through near our Ashram. In his car was his brother-in law who was 
a friend of mine. Rameshwar Prasad Singh stopped his car and came 
to our Ashram.


<P>
I asked, "Why, Rameshwar Babu?"


<P>
He answered, "I came to drink water."

 
<P>
I helped him to drink. After that Rameshwar Babu sat in the seat 
of the car. I went to his side and, folding my hands, said, 
"Kisans of Reora came to my place and told their sad story. Make 
compromise with them. Take some money and let them cultivate 
their land."

 
<P>
Rameshwar Babu was agitated and said, "I can't do so." I said, "I am going to 
Reora tomorrow." He retorted, "You can't reach Reora." 
I said, "Alright, I am going tomorrow."


<P>
This is an introduction to the Reora Satyagraha.

 
<P>
I reached Reora. At that time there were some standing crops in 
the field and there we held a meeting. Both women and men joined 
the meeting. The largest number of the Kisans in Reora are Bhumihars. 
Rameshwar Prasad Singh is a Bhumihar. But, he did not allow Kisans 
to live worthy of Bhumihars. Kisans were really like Fakirs. In want of 
food to eat, their little children went nearer to the trees early in 
the morning, and ate <I>Gular, Pipar, Pankar </I> which 
animals, not men, can eat. They got their money, selling their daughters, 
and managed their livelihood. On the one hand a six year old daughter, and 
on the other, thirty or thirty-five year old son. Her father got some money 
and made her married. The situation reached this miserable condition.

 
<P>
In the meeting it was decided that we would cut standing crops tomorrow, 
even if we were arrested. At that time Swamiji (Swami Sahajanand Saraswati) 
was holding a meeting at Masaura.  Jaya Prakash Narayan, Dr. Lohia and 
others were in the meeting. Though it was a duty for me to proceed there, 
I could not go there because of my work in Reora.

 
<P>
After the meeting I was going back to my Ashram. Then women came, touched 
my foot, and said that there would be no cutting if you were not here. No men 
will go to cut crops. Please come back and stay with us. We will cut together. 
I went back. After going back, next morning we had sickles for cutting and 
threads for binding with us. I started cutting. Women began to cut crops too. 
Police got information on this, but by the time they reached, crops were cut 
and kept in the Kisans's houses. We came back to my Ashram.

 
<P>
After this a case was registered. I sent a telegram to Swamiji stating that 
Satyagraha was started in Reora and I could not go to the meeting. At that 
time the District Magistrate Whittaker was an Englishman. He was a first-class 
rascal and even shot with his gun. I came back to Reora and after the 
meeting we started cultivating the field with ploughs. Thus Satyagraha 
was started. Police reached the spot and Whittaker Sahib also reached. 
They were armed with guns and others, and said that these acts of the 
Kisans were illegal. We said, "People are going to die of starvation. 
Which do you care, law or starvation? We are cultivating to fill our 
stomach. We will not leave this work. They did not say anything at 
that moment and went back after their observation.

<P>
After this incident I came back to my Ashram, and was on the way to Gaya. 
One Magistrate came from Gaya to arrest me. At Chak and Station this Magistrate 
called me and said, "Take a seat in our car. I came to arrest you." I took a 
seat in the car and was moved to a jail. Afterwards I got an information 
that Swami Sahajanand Saraswati, Jaya Prakash Narayan and almost all 
leaders reached Reora. Many workers reached too, and a camp was opened 
at Reora. A police camp was also opened. Whenever someone was going 
to work, police began to 'interfere'. When a worker entered the field with a 
hoe, they grabbed it. When someone went with a <I>lathi</I>, 
they grabbed it. When someone went with a sickle, they grabbed it.

 
<P>
Thus the movement was started. I was then in the jail. It was a very mighty 
Satyagraha. It was a big stir. Many people began to come to Reora. On the 
last day, after all the happenings, the police was ready to bury the wells 
which had been dug. Women were there to obstruct it. Six women were 
standing near each well. Ten wells were there. Sixty women were standing. 
Police said that you must bury wells. Women answered, "Alright."  Five women  
jumped into each well and said, "Alright, do bury."  Five women were inside 
each well. And then, how can the police act?  Police left the place and later 
the Magistrate's order reached them that they should close the camp and 
come back.

 
<P>
Now a way to the settlement was opened. Whittaker wrote to Rameshwar Prasad 
Singh, Zamindar that you should make a compromise with his Kisans. Some Kisans 
were arrested and in the jail. I was also in the jail. Whittaker wrote that you should 
make a compromise with Jadunandan Sharma. Negotiations started.  In this the wish 
of Jaya Prakash Narayan was that there should be a compromise. I was not 
ready to do so. But, Kisans said that we should make a compromise. A settlement 
was reached in such a way that three-forths of the land should be allotted to 
Kisans and one-forth to the Zamindar. We reached the settlement. Whittaker 
was maneuvering behind the scene and the settlement is known as 'Whittaker 
Award'. In this Award it was written that three acres should be allotted to every 
family. All should be allotted the same size of land.


<P>
I asked Whittaker, "Are you a socialist or an imperialist?" Whittaker said, 
"No, I am an imperialist."


<P>
"Then why are you adopting socialism ? Three acres to every Kisan 
is nothing but socialism."


<P>
"Sharma Ji, now accept the situation as it is. Then, if you have to fight 
again, do so."

<P>
We talked like this.

 
<P>
Thus ended the Reora Satyagraha. Those Kisan who had no land got 
their land. The characteristic of the Kisan movement in Gaya District 
was that landless labourers also co-operated with the Kisan movement. 
Therefore I provided the land we got to the landless labourers too.
