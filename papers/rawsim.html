<p>The contrast between early Gangetic agriculture and that of early northern China offers
some useful insights for understanding later Gangetic trends and events.
Recent works by 
China scholars such as Kang Chao, Dwight Perkins, Cho-yun Hsu, and E. N. Anderson,
have suggested strong relationships among early high population densities, the creation of
intensive farming techniques. and styles of cuisine.
<a name="rf02"></a><a href="#N_02_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> The early 
large population in the Hwang He River basin and delta of
northern China, with its "self-fertilizing" loess soil. resulted in the deforestation of the Loess
Plateau watershed. A long-term. historical trajectory was thus set in place of intensive
agricultural input management. The early culinary styles of northern China consisted of
intensively preparing foods prior to cooking and then, because of a lack of plentiful
firewood, rapidly par-cooking in a wok that requires only grass and crop residues to fuel
the short fire and cook the near raw food. The Chinese case is well documented by others.
This paper proposes a contrasting case for the Gangetic Plain: the simmered food.

<p>The Gangetic Plain<a name="rf03"></a><a href="#N_03_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
nurtured a less intensive mode of crop input management which was
due to the early formation of agricultural systems within an abundant forest and biomass
context of adjacent agriculture, unlike China, and without the early population pressure that
occurred in China. The householder's culinary styles in the early Gangetic Plain entailed
intensively preparing foods before cooking but then using a significantly larger requirement
of slow burning fuel, than in China, for steady simmering processes of preparing pulses,
spices, and vegetables with the oil of clarified butter, or ghee, as well as

<p><b>++Page 2</b>

<p>fuel for a preparation of either rice or wheat/millet. The preparation of ghee, itself is fuel
intensive, in contrast to the absence of milk and milk products in 
China.<a name="rf04"></a><a href="#N_04_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

<p>Gangetic cultivators, prior to the nineteenth century, relied on increasing production
through the extension of cultivated area rather than intensifying production per plot as in
early northern China. This Gangetic style of agriculture worked very well as long as
population remained moderate and adjacent forest and biomass remained plentiful.
<a name="rf05"></a><a href="#N_05_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> Such
extensive systems gave cultivators options and choices as to how much to produce at any
one season and this no doubt offered flexibility in their relations with overlords seeking
rent/tribute from their surplus. As I will suggest later, the decline in this flexibility during the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries would alter the context of agrarian relations.

<p>Prior to the sixteenth century, Gangetic forest and biomass declined imperceptibly as
population increased gradually There was not the compelling rise in population density, as in
early China, that might have signaled and forced a grand system change at that time.
However. with the slow decline in adjacent biomass gangetic cultivators did begin to change.
But without strong signals indicating their changed environmental context. cultivators were
lulled into. in a sense, a scavenger-input, and incremental coping version of the former
system. Since the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, cultivators in this new system
skillfully adapted to a more heavy reliance on short-term, risk-averting strategies that are
commonly described in world peasant literature. They had now only marginal soils left into
which they could extend cultivation and were now, in a sense, with their backs against the
wall regarding natural resource inputs.

<p><b>++Page 3</b>

<p>This new mode of agriculture represents the type of agricultural system found in the plain
during the past century. When a compelling rise in population density did occur in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. the resources for inputs were so meager. as illustrated by
the rapid increase in the use of cow dung for household fuel instead of crop manure, that
when the ponderous agrarian, political-tenurial framework of the colonial period combined
with these conditions the total effect weighed too heavily upon the agricultural population to
allow for the needed grand system change in the mode of resource input management. As
land-use statistics show, the rich context of adjacent biomass was lost by the time of the
compelling increase in population density during the past century. This historical timing was
a fateful cruel trick and would have tragic consequences for the Gangetic Plain. Of course
these consequences varied throughout the plain and later I will trace the course of changes in
three main regions, concluding with that of Bihar.

<p>Before looking into the details of the story, we must understand here that in the history Of
world agriculture Gangetic India was perhaps incomparable. Over the millennia there was
never a "know-how" problem regarding how to intensify product on the same plot. There was
never a time when indigenous knowledge of agriculture was not first-rate in the world.
Remember, transplanted, wet rice was first designed and used in the world, during the sixth
century B.C.E., in the amply watered fields below the Rajgir Hills in Patna District in
hundreds of ancient villages such as Nalanda and Aungari. Rather, the issue in this paper is
that even with this sophisticated knowledge base over time, there still needed to be a
compelling historical force to redirect the modes of cultivation on a day-to-day level. And
that would not happen.

<p><b>++Page 4</b>

<font size="+2"><b>The Distinctive Character of Gangetic Agricultural History</b></font>

<p>Recent archaeological studies have stressed that early technology may not have radically
changed the distribution of vegetation as much as previously thought.
<a name="rf06"></a><a href="#N_06_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> The earl impact of
mining and the use of iron tools was often considered as preconditioning the patterns of
settlement and state formation during the first millennium B.C.E. This view is now softened
with greater emphasis on the critical development of strong social and political 
institutions.<a name="rf07"></a><a href="#N_07_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

<p>Ghosh and Lal have suggested that the process of forest clearance was gradual. and in
stride with the needs of the patterns of settlement expansion, rather than a process of
massive clearance following the introduction of iron tools. Lal views this slow clearance
process as the historical norm until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when a faster
rate of clearance began.
<a name="rf08"></a><a href="#N_08_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> This slower clearance 
process indicates a relatively large area of
forest, woods, and natural vegetation that was interpatterned with natural topography and
human settlements.<a name="rf09"></a><a href="#N_09_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

<p>To help interpret these land use data, I draw upon a body of literature developed since 
the 1960s termed "agricultural intensification theory."
<a name="rf10"></a><a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> This 
literature stems from Ester Boserup
who made population change an independent variable rather that one that was dependent on
changes in agricultural technology, organization, and production. For Boserup, agriculture
responds to demographic changes by adjusting investment in labor, technology, and land use.
This is pushed along by declining marginal returns 
to labor with the increase of population
density. Population density, then, is at least one important driver of agricultural change.
Therefore, intensification of agriculture occurs either as (1)

<p><b>++Page 5</b>

<p>increased investments of labor and improved inputs of nutrients. technology, organization.
On existing plots of land. as in early northern China, or as (2) increased investments of
labor, and /or these same inputs of new extended plots of land. I would argue that the latter
fits best with the evidence available for the Gangetic Plain.

<p>Using statistical data from Mughal records, as interpreted by Irfan Habib and Shireen
Moosvi, roughly two-thirds of the Gangetic Plain remained under natural vegetation in 1600
(see Figure). I have discussed elsewhere the ecological benefits, both direct and indirect,
from the close juxtaposition of field and forest/woods. One example is that with the decline
of forest and woods, and therefore fuelwood, cow dung became increasingly used for
heating fuel and thus potentially diverted from use as cropping manure. Habib notes that in
1600 there was a liberal use of cow dung as crop manure except in the 
Delhi-Agra area.<a name="rf11"></a><a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

<p>The cultivator in 1600 had productive options in his negotiations with overlords which
would be unavailable to his modern counterparts. Options of being able to regulate
production were virtually eliminated with the decline of the rich biomass environment.

<p><a name="agri"></a>
<font size="+2"><b>Agricultural Changes Since the Eighteenth Century</b></font>

<p>With the slow decline in the natural area of biomass since the seventeenth century, the
following eight features seem to characterize the new mode of cultivation. The first was the
decline in crop nutrition that accompanied less use of the option of manuring cereal
grains as well as the decline of indirect manuring within an adjacent, abundant biomass.
<a name="rf12"></a><a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>
This affected the general nutrient level, humus content, and moisture level of the plain.
<a name="rf13"></a><a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> 
Scarce manure and sweepings were increasingly used only for household gardenplots and

<p><b>++ Page 6</b>

<p>specialty crops such as betel leaf, sugarcane, or opium.
<a name="rf14"></a><a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> The decline of 
staple crop manuring
seemed to follow a spatial pattern of first appearing in the populous wet regions and then
throughout the less populous dry zones.
<a name="rf15"></a><a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> By 1945, the lack of 
staple crop manuring had
become so commonplace that the colonial government cited it as one of the chief reasons for
low production, while at the same time not recognizing that it was formerly part of the
agricultural system. For example, in the words of the Bengal Famine Inquiry Commission's
final report:

<p>"Hitherto the use of manures has been confined largely to the more profitable among the
cash crops. such as tobacco, sugarcane, and vegetables, and the amount of manure applied to
the land on which the main crops are grown has been very small."
<a name="rf16"></a><a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

<p>A second feature was increased intercropping of pulses with cereal grain. Instead of
manuring staple crops, cultivators adapted by stressing their traditional technique of
intercropping which contributed nitrogen to the soil and also worked as a valuable hedge
against total crop failure because drought resistant pulses would survive when the grain did
not.<a name="rf17"></a><a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>

<p>Thirdly, cultivators in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also adapted to much
greater use of double or multi-cropping, that is, cropping in different seasons, often but not
always in the same plot.
<a name="rf18"></a><a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> Although it was 
a nutrient-draining practice, it was seen
as an important short-term hedge against crop 
failure.<a name="rf19"></a><a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>

<p>A fourth feature in the new style of agriculture was that livestock was afforded both
added importance and less to eat. The resource base for them to eat was greatly reduced.
<a name="rf20"></a><a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a> But
the cultivator increased his need for their power to turn newly extended marginal lands, as a
source for special crop manure, and as a source of household 
fuel.<a name="rf21"></a><a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>

<p><b>++Page 7</b><br>

<img align=right src="http://www.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/img/hagenc.jpg"></a>

A fifth feature was that as cultivators tightened their use of manure and sweepings 
during the nineteenth century. they also decreased their own production of seed grain. Seed
production soon lost its urgency in the new agricultural style when the trade-off was some
increase in food production. Cultivators. with a short term view, now easily took the seed
credit offered by their moneylenders and/or landlords, as this was an integral part
of a larger relationship of credit bonding between these 
parties.<a name="rf22"></a><a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>

<p>A sixth point was the loss of indigenous irrigation within a context of increasing need tor
such. The primary obstacle to more effective, and maintenance of irrigation was the trend in
greater subdivision of land rights as by then rigidly defined in the new colonial legal regime.
The increased number of persons responsible through subdivision caused greater disrepair in
the irrigation systems. This was most acute in the deeply structured land systems of the
eastern region where irrigation systems operated within produce rent areas such as in Bihar.
Such areas were profit-related to good irrigation maintenance. Therefore when produce rents
were commuted in the 1 9~0s there began a trend of these landlords disregarding their
irrigation responsibilities.<a name="rf23"></a><a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>

<p>A seventh feature was a trend toward regional crop specialization rather than local
mixed cropping.
<a name="rf24"></a><a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> 
Where formerly there was a mix in varieties of plants, such as cotton,
sugarcane, grains, oilseeds, and pulses. there now became more monocropping determined
by how a particular soil type faired under the new low levels of nutrient and organic
inputs. <a name="rf25"></a><a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>

<p>A final feature in the new context of tightened resources and urgent production goals was
a destruction in the cultivators option of leaving plots fallow.
<a name="rf26"></a><a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> This no-fallowing trend was
heightened, at the end of the nineteenth century, which I have proposed and described

<p><b>++Page 8</b>

<p>elsewhere. as the optimal geographical extent of cultivation was reached in more and more
districts of the plain. Gangetic cultivators. as argued here, had operated their agriculture
using the extension of land within a plentiful biomass. They had always worked with the
option of building their nutrient and organic soil bases through rotating and resting older
lands.
<a name="rf27"></a><a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> 
This Gangetic heritage was now at an end.
<a name="rf28"></a><a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>

<p><a name="comp"></a>
<font size="+2"><b>Comparisons Among Gangetic Regions, 1600-1980</b></font>

<p>With the signs of steadily rising population densities and declining
biomass. why didn't Gangetic cultivators change or intensify their styles
and systems to the dramatic degree needed to counteract these challenges?
The three main regions of the Gangetic Plain. the lower wet region, the
middle, mixed region of Bihar, and the upper dry region each experienced
the common trends in quite different ways.

<p>The lower, wet region was the most prosperous and successful in 1600. Gifted with
natural moisture, soil fertility, and a thriving seagoing export trade, the wet region was
self-described as "golden Bengal." Population increased roughly 500 percent between 1600
and 1980 but it did not alert or compel agricultural changes because of the historical timing
of the increases. In 1770 a devastating, entitlement famine over the western areas of the
region served as a major disincentive for intensification at a crucial point over time w-hich
was the beginning of the colonial period. An estimated one-third of the population died in
the affected areas. Cultivation was withdrawn from many lands and long fallow
areas were created.
<a name="rf29"></a><a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a> 
The tragic event offered a false signal to cultivators and initiated a new
round of arable extension. However this time, tribal labor, mainly Santals, recruited
from nearby uplands, were used to extend cultivation.
<a name="rf30"></a><a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>

<p><b>++Page 9</b>

<p>The 1770 famine for decades to come, masked the true conditions in the region. A
number of factors continued to hid the effects of biomass depletion and regionally rising 
population density. The most important was the continuing existence, until about 1900. of
additional culturable land for expansion. A second factor was the continuous string, over
centuries. of export-led cash crops. In 1600 these consisted of the famous silky cotton near
Dhaka, as well as an export trade in rice, sugar, and ghee. In the eighteenth century indigo
became a sensational export, and then jute followed in the nineteenth century. Jute had an
additional masking impact. The British introduced a growing demand for jute for their home
manufacturing but such extractive trade did not encourage agricultural intensification. It
eliminated fertile land areas of food production and locked tenants and wage laborers into
poverty given the heavily structured and inequitable land-access systems in East Bengal. In
these circumstances, cultivators had no opportunities to respond to signals encouraging
water and land intensification.

<p>In the late nineteenth century the British deforested the Irrawaddy Delta of Burma and
very cheap rice came to Bengal. Rather than incite competitive rice intensification in
Bengal, its effect, at this crucial time, was to muffle such urges. Finally, the more plentiful
rainfall of this region allowed for quicker regrowth and therefore at least a minimum of
grass and scrub vegetation which was very sparse in the other regions.

<p>After 1900, a number of conditions in the wet region seemed compelling enough to
perhaps modify the agricultural system. These were the absence of potentially new lands,
the dramatic decline in natural vegetation in non-inundated areas which had been more
dependent on adjacent use of the landscape, and the decline in the mortality rate which put
population pressure on rural society.

<p><b>++Page 10</b>

<p>Why didn't the systems of the wet region change at this point ? One immediate answer
was the escape-valve migration of peasants at this time. especially from Mymensingh
District, into the riverine areas of Assam. Another answer was the continued availability of
cheap rice from Burma. However, it seems that the main reason may be. as James Boyce has
suggested, the heavy burden by this time, that existed in the agrarian system and structure in
the face of signals to change.<a name="rf31"></a><a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>

<p>The dry region has had the lowest population density history of the three regions since
1600. It has also had the least to loose by the common rends of the plain. The conventional
picture of the dr; region is that of a hard-won agricultural surplus derived from the most
drought-prone regions of the plain. At least part of this picture may by misleading.

<p>Two underlying ecological factors contribute to a somewhat different and balanced
assessment. Both factors are indicated from the research of scientists and have yet to be
integrated into historical explanation. The first is the nature of the different rivers. The silt
from high glacier-fed rivers. such as the Ganges and Jumna, having traversed extensive
highland areas, gives greater fertility than do the lower hill or lake fed rivers such as those of
Rohilkhand and Awadh. This high fertility is also the case with the snow
fed alluviums of Haryana and Punjab.
<a name="rf32"></a><a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a> This effect 
has softened the impact of the breakdown
in the traditional field-biomass system in these areas.

<p>A second factor affecting the dry region is the specific specie distribution of grasses and
livestock. The ecology of grass communities in these areas indicates some of the most
advantageous species, for livestock, found in South Asia. Comparable quality grass
distributions are only found in the now diary-rich district of former Baroda State in

<p><b>++ Page 11</b>

<p>Gujarat. Chief among these grasses is the protein-rich, drought resistant jargu grass
(Dichanthium annulatum). Its highly palatable and nutritious companion is cenchrus ciliaris.
These important grasses are dominant in the dry region and only found in patches elsewhere
in the plain. They can survive down to a bare soil extinction and then reappear
as an annual.
<a name="rf33"></a><a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a> 
These grasses provided a buffer against the general trend of biomass
depletion. The added livestock. however. countered this buffer by creating landscapes of
erosion.

<p>The millet/wheat cropping pattern of the dry region restricted
population density compared to the rice regions. This gave the dry region a
stronger position in its response to the general trends. This was enhanced
still further by the tremendous capital investment by the colonial
government since the 1830s in canal irrigation works. A final feature that
aided the dry region was the more prevalent kind of agrarian-tenurial
systems that were lighter in structure and often included
owner-cultivators. These light systems reflected the mode of dry grain
cultivation with its simpler labor requirements. This may have allowed
agriculture to respond more quickly to demographic, market, and
environmental forces compared to those of the other regions.

<p>The middle region of Bihar and eastern U.P. was a mixture of the other regions. This mix
made it the most vulnerable in the interplay among the trends of biomass depletion,
population changes, and arable extension. Its weakness was not being securely wet nor
consistently dry. Over the past four centuries, rice continued to be the primary cereal crop. 
However, rice was always a highly problematic crop because of the insecure 
monsoon climate in the middle plain. 
<a name="rf34"><a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a> 
Especially for south Bihar, water management has been of
critical importance.

<p><b>++ Page 12</b>

<p>Rice production allows more calories per unit area to be made available to encourage an
increasing population density. 
<a name="rf35"><a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a> Such a context 
did not prepare the middle region for the
head-on meeting of the general trends of the plain. The social context of agriculture has been
a combination of the dry and wet regions. However, because of the primacy of rice rural
society is therefore more of a reflection of the wet rice agrarian system. Like the wet region,
it appears that the labor demands of wet rice encourages a distinction between those that
actually ploughed. called chase, and those that did not hold the plough. Like the wet region,
most of the mixed region was "permanently settled" in 1793. Therefore. the social context of
agriculture for the region represented the very ponderous and thick combination of
increasing subdivisions of holdings and the bottom-heavy kind of rural society that stemmed
from the labor requirements of wet rice cultivation. However, the middle region seems to
have taken this heavy agrarian structure on step further than that found in the wet region.
This was perhaps because of the critical necessity of mobilizing water management. Like the
wet region. this heavy agrarian structure represents a primary reason that when population
densities began to rise at a compelling rate the agricultural systems were not able to respond.

<p>Of the three regions, the middle had the most to loose by depletion of natural vegetation
for it was not a cattle breeding area with the nutritious grasses of the western plain. The
creation of a savannah landscape was more of a strain on rural society compared with the dry
region. Unlike the wet region, most of the middle region did not have a rapid regeneration
of at least a scrubland cover of vegetation. The decline of biomass was particularly severe
by the end of the nineteenth century at which time most district had reached their optimal
extent of cultivated area. Although the middle region

<p><b>++ Page 13</b>

<p>began with less depletion of total area than the dry region. my land-use reconstructions
indicate that by 1890 the middle region had more of its total area in a degraded condition
than the dry region.

<p>As elsewhere in the Gangetic Plain. biomass depletion and arable expansion w-ere
masked by a continuing supply of culturable lands. As these increasingly marginal soils
came to an end, towards the end the nineteenth century, the stark picture of rural social
distress began to appear. Tenants and sub-tenants, competing over more and more marginal
soil types. began to assert their customary rights against each other and against their
overlords. Because the middle region had the most to loose by these processes that were
common to the plain, it is not surprising to see that the middle region became the epicenter
and most active area of peasant-land conflict in the plain and perhaps in South
Asia. <a name="rf36"><a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>  Under the 
former, biomass-abundant 
style of agriculture, of say 1600, cultivators had
the water and nutrient inputs necessary to adjust production needs. They were thus in a
stronger bargaining position in their relations with overlords. 
<a name="rf37"><a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a> 
 However, in the new style of
input-poor agriculture, evolving during the eighteenth and nineteen centuries, their
production elasticity virtually vanished and their bargaining position with overlords became
similarly affected. This kind of tightening in the productive options, or productive power, in
rural society was a general process and effect throughout the entire Gangetic
Plain. <a name="rf38"><a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a> 
All levels of society were affected and the process raised the level of tensions among
competing groups. In the 1920s this was the context at least partly responsible for the
creation of South Asia's primary peasant organization, the all-India Kisan sabha. 
<a name="rf39"><a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a> 
Organized first in the south Bihar district of Patna in the middle region.

<p><b>++ Page l4</b>

<p>ln conclusion, there is reason to believe that undetected below our many constructions of
Gangetic agrarian history since 1600 there was a significant shift in the productive options
of cultivators. If the history of Gangetic agriculture was to extend cultivation to meet the
needs of a growing population, then today s lack prosperity is understandable because
although population increased 430 percent between 1600 and 1980, arable was extended
only 112 percent

<p><a name="N_22_">22.</a> In 1890, John Voelcker, after 
touring the Gangetic Plain, observed that "the root
of the mischief lies in the system by which the cultivator is not his own seed merchant,
but is entirely dependent on the baniya, mahajan, or similar individual of the
money-lending class. These men supply the raiyat with seed, charging interest at an
exorbitant rate, for they know that he must have seed or else he cannot grow his crop.
The accounts between merchant and cultivator, thus begun over seed transactions, are
seldom allowed to lapse, and often assume enormous proportions, leading to
mortgaging of land and other evils." Voelcker, "Improvement of Indian Agriculture," p.
236, see also pp. 237-240. For additional examples of the decline of cultivator seed
production, see C. E. R. Girdlestone, <b><i>Report of Past Famines in the NorthWestern

<p><a name="N_25_">25.</a> In recent decades, the World 
Bank has consistently encouraged this trend,
which usually involves increasing exportable cash crops in Third World lands as the
most 'rational' development policy despite the very risky consequence of losing
lands that had produced subsistence crops. The history of Gangetic agriculture
indicates how this monocropping trend can be partly the product of growing soil
impoverishment. Export-led, cash-monocropping is facing growing criticism due to
the strong shift toward concern for sustainability in both the economic and
environmental dimensions of development. For example, see Michael Redclift,
