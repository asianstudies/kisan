<p><em><a name="intr">1. Introduction</a></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The subject of this symposium is directly related to Walter's research and writing over the
past forty years: he has consistently brought into the open the materials of peasant struggle in
Bihar (and other parts of India) and he has provided a searching and important analysis of those
materials. All of us are better off for his work on Swami Sahajanand  Saraswati and the <em>kisan
sabhas</em>. As we all know, such peasant struggles are not by any means a thing of the past; but now,
along with peasants in many parts of India, there are many other groups - deprived and exploited
groups - who are fighting for their rights and (in many cases) their very existence. This paper deals
with one such group - the artisanal fishers of Kerala who, in the late 20th century, have had to
struggle against the effects of processes of technological change and economic 'reform' which
have severely disadvantaged and increasingly marginalised them so that there have been at times
fears that they would have the very basis of their work and existence taken from them<a href="#N_2_">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In fishing terms, Kerala is a very significant region: with 10% of India's coastline and 7%
of India's continental shelf, the state produced 24% of the total marine catch in the 1980s and
accounted for some 40% of India's seafood exports<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. In the 
early 1960s, artisanal fishers
numbered about 85,000<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>; by the 1980s that figure was over 
106,000 but by then there were also
17,500 workers in the mechanised fisheries sector<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>; the artisanal 
fishers had some 34,000 craft and
produced over 60% of the  marine catch while there were 3,000 mechanised boats in the 'modern'
sector<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>. This is the context for the fisher activity which the 
paper seeks to trace.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><a name="kera">2. Kerala's Fishers</a></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Kerala was formed in 1956 from the former princely states of Travancore and Cochin, the
Madras district of Malabar and the South Kanara taluk of Kasaragod. The combination of these
regions produced a state in which the artisanal marine fishers are Hindu and Muslim in  the
northern and central coastal villages and Latin Catholic in the southern coastal districts
<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>.
Christians comprise 37% of the fisher population of the state, Muslims 30% and Hindus 27%. In
the northern and central districts, Hindus and Muslims have preponderance in different districts;
but in the southern districts Christian predominance is very marked: 'in Trivandrum almost 75 per
cent and in each of the other districts around 50 per cent'<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The technology and social structuring of artisanal fisheries in Kerala varies in relation to
different ecological conditions along the coast. Nieuwenhuys and Meynen make the point
succinctly, but with slightly different emphases, in their articles from the end of the 1980s:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Artisanal fishery, [Nieuwenhuys explains], is but a general term for fishing
techniques that are far from homogeneous. The design of the craft used along the
coastline varies, being closely adapted to the physical geography of the coast and
the habits of the fish. It ranges from the large and costly dug-out or plank-built
canoe found in the north to the rudimentary catamaran of the south that consists
of just five logs of wood tied together. The size, shape and material of nets used
by these boats show an even greater degree of variation. Broadly speaking, in the
south a fisherman often owns his own catamaran. By contrast, in the centre and
north a fisherman is more likely to be recruited by one of the few men of substance
who possess a large canoe.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

<p>From north to south, [Meynen writes], the sea becomes rougher and the surf
stronger, while the heterogeneity of fish species becomes greater and the
proportions in which fish of a certain species occur become smaller. Accordingly,
towards the south boats and crews tended to be smaller, boats and fishing gear
showed a larger variety and fishing units (boat-crew-gear combinations) tended
to be increasingly flexible. Thus production structures along the central and
northern coasts were more unequal and the fishing communities more stratified
than those of the southern coast<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>.

<p>These variations provide contextual elements for the pattern of fisher organisation and activity in
the 1980s and 1990s; we will see that organisation is earliest in some of the southern coastal
districts and among and less stratified, Latin Catholic fishers.

<p>Among these artisanal fishers an important accumulation of skill and knowledge of local
conditions was preserved. Here, as elsewhere in India,<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> 
the fishers handled the marine
environment with courage and resourcefulness. Kurien makes the point very forcibly: 

<p>The greatest asset of the fishermen of Kerala is their accumulated knowledge
about fish, fish habits, waves, currents and stars which they have, through
generations of learning by doing, handed down from generation to generation.
<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>

<p>But outsiders often had no appreciation of this. As a result, that much of the discussion India's
fisheries and fishers has been negative. Professor K. T. Shah, a leading nationalist economist and
the General Secretary of the Congress National Planning Committee, was openly disparaging.
Speaking to the National Planning Committee he dismissed the "traditional" fishing sector as:

<p>largely of a primitive character, carried on by ignorant, unorganised and ill-equipped fishermen. Their techniques are rudimentary, their tackle elementary,
their capital equipment slight and inefficient.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>

<p>It is hardly surprising, therefore, that when planned development began in India at the beginning
of the 1950s, the nation's fisheries were seen as a case just waiting for 'development'.

<p><em><a name="chan">3.  Change in Kerala fisheries</a></em>

<p>Both the Travancore and Cochin state administrations had shown some interest in
developing their fisheries and there had been some developments - through the Madras Fisheries
Department and the institution of the fish-curing yards - in Malabar before independence.
<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>

<p>Planned development aimed at 'modernisation', however, came with independent India's first Five
Year Plan. In that plan an aid project funded by the Norwegian government - the 'Indo-Norwegian 
Project' (INP) which commenced in three Quilon villages in 1952<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>
 - played a key role
in changing Kerala's fisheries. The aim of the INP (as in all Five Year Plan programs for marine
fisheries) was the introduction of mechanised boats and a new approach to fishing and fish
marketing. Initially this mechanisation was in the form of motors for traditional craft, but this
proved unsatisfactory to the Norwegians in the Kerala case<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a> 
and the INP development programs
switched to European-type boats, with in-board motors. The INP had distributed 88 boats in
Kerala by 1962 and the Department of Fisheries had distributed another 25, with 14 held back for
training.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> Mathur reported from his field work in 
the late 1960s that mechanisation was the key
change among the Mappila fishermen of the north<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>; 
there were 20 mechanised boats in the region
in Malabar where he did his research. With this shift to mechanisation came a concern for larger
size units and, initially,  a trawling approach to fishing in deeper waters than had been traditionally
fished; Mathur reported boats fishing in 35-75 fathoms and going as far as 12 km from the shore
<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>.
 
Development plans envisaged an increase in productivity and in employment; the National Council
of Applied Economic Research's <em>Techno-Economic Survey</em> for Kerala in the early 1960s gave a
picture of a fishing industry moving towards an almost complete shift to a 'modern' sector
<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>.

<p>New forms of gear, such as nylon nets, were also introduced and attention was given to
new forms of processing.  In the past drying and curing had been the methods used but freezing
became increasingly important because it was the basis of an export trade in frozen prawns as a
commodity for US and Japanese markets.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> 
Prawns were plentiful in Kerala waters and were
previously exported dried to Sri Lanka and Burma. The US and Japanese markets were much
more lucrative, however, and as a consequence one of Kerala's chief marine resources led to
major changes in both the organisation of fishing and of fish marketing. The prawn catch, and the
take overall, reached new heights in 1973; thereafter there was a decline - a matter of great
concern to inshore, artisanal fishers - although there was still considerable profit in the export-oriented sectors.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>

<p><em></em>These changes meant that newer units of fishing production were developed round the
mechanised boats and trawlers; and in the south these new units were often in the control of 
non-traditional fishermen because the capital investment in such boats and gear, and their maintenance,
was well beyond the reach of most artisanal fishers. Those who had access to capital from fish
trading or broking, or who were linked to other capital resources, were those who became owners
and who stood to reap the profits of the new enterprises.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a> 
In the north, on Mathur's evidence,
the wealthier fishermen turned the situation to their own advantage<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>. 
The fishing industry became
increasingly polarised between a 'modern' ('mechanised') sector able to make considerable profits
from exports and a 'traditional' ('non-mechanised') sector confined to a domestic market with
declining catches and fish stock. In the 1980s the increasing industrialisation - and
internationalisation - of the fisheries by mechanisation and by trawling by still larger vessels, both
by Indian companies and by trawlers of other nations (the Japanese, the Thais and the Taiwanese
were all active), heightened this polarisation and posed  dangers which threatened to do serious
damage to the both the fisheries and the artisanal fishers.

<p>The effects were already clear by the late 1970s and early 1980s. Fishers found themselves
physically endangered as trawlers worked too close in-shore (there were a number of cases of
collisions, especially at night). Income levels began to reflect the disadvantaged position of the
artisanal fishers. Kurien, for example, showed that the per capita income of workers in the
mechanised sector had risen from Rs 1,610 to Rs 8,029 over the 1970s, while that of workers in
the non-mechanised sector rose only from Rs 1,095 to Rs 1,527 in the same period<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
. Artisanal
fishers - still the largest group in the industry - were in many ways marginalised. Certainly some
groups - entrepreneurs profiting from the export trade; those who worked on mechanised boats;
some women for whom new job opportunities had opened up<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>
 - were better-off but, overall, the
situation of the majority worsened. It seemed that artisanal fishers, unless they joined the modern
sector, were unlikely to be able to compete.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>

<p>There were two dangers. Firstly, lacking capital and with their traditional assets
increasingly being neutralised - the speed of motors, for instance, neutralised any skill in rowing
or sailing; the catch-all nature of trawling and the use of fish-finding equipment neutralised older
knowledge and skill in 'knowing' fish and so on - artisanal fishers seemed to be in a position in
which they would be completely marginalised. Secondly, there was the danger that the coastal
marine resources would be depleted to a point from which they could not recover and  then those
whose livelihood depended on fishing in coastal waters would have the very basis of their work
and existence taken from them. Such problems were  being canvassed by Goan fishers and by the
earliest Kerala fishers unions in the 1960s and they were seen as a very real threats.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a> 
These
dangers framed the context in which the artisanal fishers of Kerala had to struggle.

<p><em><a name="stru">4. The struggle</a></em>

<p>We can think of the struggle by the fishers as falling into three important phases. There
was firstly a formative period in the 1960s and 1970s when the fishers' organisations - at a
district, state and national level - were being formed. This was a period which was to have
important implications for leadership and direction in the Kerala movements because of the close
connection between these movements and the Roman Catholic Church. The second period was
the period of agitation and struggle in the 1980s and into the 1990s as the fishers brought
pressure on successive Kerala governments - and, on occasion, on the central government - to
address their concerns. In these campaigns they particularly targeted the impact which mechanised
fishing made both on their livelihoods and on fish resources. It was a period in which they
experienced great difficulty in combating vested interests in the state and in getting an adequate
response from the coalition governments which were a feature of Kerala politics throughout the
period. The last period comes in the 1990s when the issues which the Kerala fishers had been
fighting for increasingly become national issues. In this third period the national-level organisation
formed in the 1970s, an organisation in which Kerala fishers and their supporters are leaders, has
come to  play an increasingly militant role on fisheries' policy, to the extent that the Government
of India has been forced to consider how to meet the political opposition and how to protect fish
resources.

<p><em><a name="form">4.1. The formative period</a></em>

<p>This period saw the development of 'unions' at the district level,<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>
 particularly in the
central and southern districts. The earliest of these unions was formed in Quilon in 1963 and the
process continued up to the late 1970s and early 1980s by which time there were district unions
in Alleppey, Cochin, Trivandrum and Malabar districts.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a> 
There were also women's organisations
(<em>Mahila Samajams</em>) which were NGO-initiated.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>

<p>The important feature of the early unions was the role of the Catholic clergy in their
formation and development. In the way that the process has been reported by Fr. Puthenveed it
most often seems to be a priest who took the initiative in the formation of the unions and they 
certainly usually took 'presidential' roles in the unions. However, there was involvement of the
laity from the fisher communities from the outset. The leading role of the clergy was  important 
because, firstly, this meant that Latin Catholic fishers were the most effectively organised from
an early period and, secondly, because it linked the fishers' unions to the outlook of individual
clergy and to the agenda of the Church and (what of major importance in the Kerala situation)
to the political alliances of the Church.

<p>In the early years there was no problem so far as the Church was concerned in the clergy's
involvement with the unions. Initially the unions were seen to have general 'welfare' objectives
which were unexceptional. Moreover, the hierarchy of the Church was itself prepared to mobilise
the fishers for political purposes since they constituted a major part of the Church's
'constituency'. It seems clear, for example, that fishers were used in the demonstrations which
the Church - in alliance with Congress Party - organised to enable central intervention to bring
down the CPI government of Kerala in 1959.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>

<p>In 1977 the district unions which then existed came together to form the <em>Kerala Latheen
Catholica Malsia Thozhilalee Federation</em> (KLCFF). This state-level organisation had strong
clerical leadership but it also had prominent lay leaders who had been active in the formation of
the district unions. There are some suggestions that in this form the KLCFF had some difficulty
in attracting Hindu or Muslim fishers and it was possibly to that end that, in 1980, it changed its
name to <em>Akhili Kerala Swathantra Malsia Thozhilalee Federation</em> (AKSMTF) - the 'All-Kerala
Independent Fishermen's Federation'<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>

<p>In 1978 the AKSMTF joined with similar groups from Goa and Tamil Nadu to form the
'National Forum for Catamaram and Country Boat Fishermen's Rights and Marine Wealth'. This
organisation, which, came to be called the 'National Fishermen's Forum' (NFF) later provided
a national-level organisation from that time on.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a> 
Like the district and state level organisations,
the NFF had Church support and the involvement of clergy in its initial phase. From 1980
onwards these three levels of organisation - district, state and national - provided the basis for
fisher agitation.

<p><em><a name="agit">4.2. Agitation</a></em>

<p>The first fisher agitations were by women from the <em>Mahila Samajam</em> in Trivandrum
District. The women's organisation pre-dated the formation of the Trivandrum District
Fishermen's Union (TDFU)<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a> 
and the women  - who were the fishvendors in the markets and
inland villages - began an agitation in 1979 for a statutory right to use public transport. They did
not win this right in the two years of their agitation but the Fisheries Department had to organise
special buses for them.  The <em>Mahila Samajam</em> played little direct role in the later activity because
the women were absorbed into the TDFU when it was formed in 1980. However, as Meynen
points out,  women continued to be 'the backbone of the unionisation process'.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>

<p>The representation of the fishers' demands led in 1980 to the enactment of the Kerala
Marine Fisheries Regulation Act and the establishment of welfare and housing schemes for fishers
by the Left and Democratic Front (LDF)-led Nayanar government.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>
 In theory, the legislation met
the problems of trawlers and mechanised boats fishing in the inshore waters which were the
principal fishing grounds of the artisanal fishers. This inshore fishing by the mechanised boats and
trawlers took toll of the important fish stock on which the artisanal fishers depended; it caused
ecological damage because of the use of bottom-trawling nets; and it  placed fishers at risk from
collisions - which became an increased risk when mechanised boats fished at night.
<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>  The welfare
and housing schemes were to meet the low standards of living experienced by fishers who were
not sharing the expanded opportunities of the 'modern' sector.

<p>In practice, the legislation remained largely unimplemented. Its effects were also severely
undermined by the success of the Trawler Boat Owners Association in a High Court action which
reduced the reserved zone limit from 22 kilometers to 10 kilometers.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>
 The AKSMTF therefore
undertook over the following decade a series of agitations to bring pressure on successive Kerala
governments to redress the situation brought about by these new conditions and, on occasions
to protest against the death of fishermen as a result of collisions with mechanised boats. These
agitations involved rallies and processions, demonstrations and hunger strikes outside the
secretariat in Trivandrum and in district headquarters and, from the mid-1980s onwards,
confrontations with mechanised boats and trawlers (which on occasion led to the destruction of
boats by burning). All of this activity was met with heavy-handed police action: <em>lathi</em> charges and,
on occasion, firings.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>

<p>In these agitations priests and nuns were prominent as organisers, demonstrators and
hunger-strikers and over the decade a particular association grew up between 'radical' priests and
nuns who brought into this Indian situation the outlook and teaching of the 'Liberation Theology'
which was espoused by a similarly radicalised clergy in Latin America.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>
 Such views were
particularly associated with Fr. Thomas Kocherry, a Redemptorist priest who came into the union
activity through the TDFU. This union, as we have seen, was one of the last formed (it started
in 1980) and Kocherry was therefore seen as taking an interest in the fishers' cause later than
some of the clergy who had been prominent in the movement in the 1960s and early 1970s. He
was dismissed by his opponents within the Church (such as Fr. Puthenveed) as a late-comer
compared with  priests such as Fr. Paul Arakkal, Fr. Albert Parisavila and Fr. Peter D'cruz who
had been active in the district unions and who were the President, Vice-President and treasurer
respectively of the KLCMTF when it was formed in 1977. Fr. Parisavila was elected President
of the AKSMTF when the Federation took its new name in 1980.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>
  Kocherry was linked to what
the press referred to as a 'Dynamic Group' of priests and nuns, many of whom were (so their
opponents alleged) Syrian Christians.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a> 
From his base in the TDFU, Fr. Kocherry moved quickly
in 1981 into the NFF and took control of that organisation - to the dismay of the older generation
of clergy and of the Bishops who met together as the Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference in
Kottayam.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>

<p>The radicalisation of the AKSMTF represented by Fr. Kocherry's entry led in 1983 to a
split in the Federation. One group (which claimed 'authenticity') was led by Fr. Kocherry; the
other (a 'loyalist' union in the eyes of the radicals) was led by Fr. Parisavila.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>
 The 'loyalist' union,
it was claimed, was formed at the insistence of the Church hierarchy and the Church's political
allied, especially the Congress-I which now led a United Democratic Front (UDF) coalition
government in Kerala under the chief ministership of Karunakaran. This split was followed by a
campaign, directed by the hierarchy, to prevent the radicals from taking part in fisher activity. Fr.
Kocherry and some of his colleagues were transferred from their parishes where they were seen
to be able to operate in the movement; Kocherry, for instance, was 'banished' to Bangalore.
There was also a campaign to repudiate the values of Liberation Theology; this is perhaps
summed-up best in Fr. Jose Puthenveed's <em>The Theology of the Fisherman in the Context of the
Fishermen's Struggle in Kerala</em> which was published in 1985 under the imprimatur of the Bishop
of Quilon. This told the story of the fishers' union movement and sought to expose both the
devious way in which Fr. Kocherry had inveigled himself and his 'Marxist' conspirators into the
movement at the expense of the true priestly friends of the fishers and the violence which was
inherent in the 'communist' views that Kocherry and the 'Dynamic Group' espoused.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>

<p>The pressures exerted through these agitations did produce some action by the state
governments. No less than three Committees were established over the 1980s - the first chaired
by Babu Paul in 1981-82; the second by A.G. Kalawar in 1984-85; and the third by Professor
Balakrishnan Nair in 1989.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a> 
These committees were charged with the task of considering
questions such as the preservation of space for the artisanal fishers and the use of certain gear
which was seen as harmful but, even more importantly, the question of a ban on fishing by
trawlers and mechanised boats in the monsoon (which was the breeding season) and which had
become a major problem. The outcomes of the first two committees, in particular, were
disappointing for the fishers and their supporters. The Paul report was completely divided on the
issues and was, in effect, a dead letter. The Kalawar report moved for a partial ban on monsoon
fishing but the Karunakaran government refused to implement such a ban because of pressure
from the organised trawler and mechanised boat owners (the Trawler Boat Owners Association
and the All-Kerala Mechanised Boat Operators' Association). These associations involved
powerful interests, amongst whom were major supporters of the political parties in the UDF.
Even within the LDF-led government at the end of the 1980s such pressures could be brought to
bear; pressure, for instance, from ministers who were themselves trawler owners and/or major fish
exporters like Baby John who was Minister for Irrigation in 1988.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>
 One tactic seized on by the
government to evade the issue - particularly in the case of the ban on monsoon (June-August)
fishing - was to declare a ban and then to exempt the stretch of coast in Quilon district (the area
in which the INP had been conducted!) which happened to have the major fishing harbours from
which the trawlers and mechanised boats in the prawn fishery operated.<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>
 The press regarded this
as a clear example of Baby John's influence. The Balakrishnan Nair committee was the most
thorough and complete in its recommendation for the breeding-season ban but its implementation
by government (as the deviousness cited above will make understandable) was still was far from
satisfactory. Even <em>Business India</em> was moved to claim in 1989 that Kerala governments did not
have the 'administrative capacity or political will to ensure proper fishery management'.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>
 In 1990
even the broader welfare schemes were put in doubt by the refusal of the fish exporters to pay the
arrears that they owed to the Kerala Fishermen's Welfare Fund. The scheme required them to pay
1% of their turnover on exports to the Fund; by 1990 they had arrears of Rs. 254 lakhs<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>


<p><em><a name="nati">4.3. National Issues</a></em>

<p>By the late 1980s there were increasing signs that fisheries' questions were being
identified at the national level and in this Kerala's movements were important. <em>India Today</em>
commented that 'fishermen all over the country are taking the cue from their counterparts in
Kerala'.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>

<p>Earlier that year the NFF had staged a major demonstration - its 'Kanykumari march'
which had been lathi-charged and fired upon by the Tamil Nadu police.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>
  This was the effective
beginning of the national-level campaigns which - while still targeting the questions of in-shore
fishing by trawlers and mechanised boats, night fishing and fishing in the breeding season, now
increasingly began to take up the issue of increasing international intervention in Indian fisheries -
officially encouraged through 'joint ventures' approved by the Government of India. <em>India
Update</em><a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a> 
reported the 'fillip' to joint ventures and noted that all of them were 'EOU' ('export-oriented undertakings').

<p>	This international intervention had built up over the 1980s and early 1990s as successive
central governments 'liberalised' the Indian economy. Beginning in 1981 with schemes for the
'charter' of foreign vessels to boost the Indian deep-sea fishing (DSF) fleet, the policy was
extended to 'leases', 'test fishing' and 'joint ventures' through policy decisions in 1986 and 1988
and 1991; the final set of changes in 1991 came as part of the Narasimha Rao government's 'new
minimal sovereignty policy' package to boost  'structural adjustment' and 'export-oriented '
reform.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a> 
This was the 'fillip' which <em>India Update </em>applauded and with which the government was
determined to proceed. Advice in April 1992 from an FAO consultant, M. Guidicelli, who had
been appointed to advise on 'the rehabilitation of sick DSF units' was disregarded; he had
recommended that the best way forward was to redeploy existing capital and labour in the DSF
fleet.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>

<p>The NFF now decided to move agitation to a national level through a 'National
Fishermen's Action Council against Joint Ventures' Fishers' <em>bandhs</em> were called on 4 February
and 23-24 November 1994 which resulted in the complete cessation of fishing and the marketing
of fish.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a> 
The pressures that the NFACAJV were now able to bring - demonstrations in the
national capital, the beginnings of action in the ports, the <em>bandhs</em> - now brought action from the
Government of India.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a> 
In December 1994 Tarun Gogoi, the Minister for Food-Processing
Industries, declared that he would 'freeze' all licences for DSF and that he would appoint a
committee to review DSF policy. That committee, comprising 16 members of the national
parliament, was appointed in February 1995 under the chairmanship of P. Murari, IAS (retd). Its
composition was regarded as entirely inadequate by the NFACAJV and - following protests and
an 8-day hunger strike by Thomas Kocherry in symbolic Porbandar -the committee was
reconstituted with the addition of 6 fishers' representatives, the Fisheries secretaries of all the
coastal states and a range of scientists and coastguard representatives, a total membership of 41.
The Murari Committee report, delivered in February 1996 contained 21 recommendations,
headed by a recommendation for the complete cessation of foreign fishing in Indian waters
through a ban on the issue of any new licences and the phasing out of all existing licences. It was
hailed as 'the most important document for the management of DSF prepared by any committee
since independence'<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a> 
and the government  appeared to agree since it gave a 'positive response'
and declared that the 1991 DSF policy would be rescinded, that all charters would cease by April
of 1997 and there would be a total ban on 'bull trawlers', that the Ministry would meet with the
NFACAJV to monitor implementation of this policy and that, in future, steps would be taken to
conserve stocks and to protect traditional fishers.<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>

<p>Although Mukul Sharma had described the report in very positive terms, <em>Labour File</em>,
called it 'a partial victory' in a later article, because it could see 'loopholes' for the government.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>
 
This has proved to be a sound judgement for the struggle to get the government to implement its
declared policy on DSF has still fully not succeeded. Nonetheless, the struggle continues. In 1997
the NFF mobilised to blockade Mumbai, Kandla and Vizakhapatnam ports, , to stage squatting
strikes in New Delhi and to organise a 'people's awareness march' by fishers along the entire
coastline of India, from Gujarat to West Bengal.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>
 '<em>Save water, save coasts, save coastal people;
Make the coastal propaganda mission a success'</em> were the slogans on pamphlet and posters of
the NFF.

<p><em> <a name="conc">5. Conclusion</a></em>

<p>Fishers as a group have traditionally had little by way of political organisation. This is in
part because fishers are  scattered along the coast - Kerala has 250 or more fishing villages along
its 590 km coastline. In part also it is because the nature of their occupation takes them out to sea
in small groups - or even individually - most days of the year so that socialisation has been
difficult. What this Kerala (and NFF) story tells therefore is a story of 25 to 30 years of
unprecedented organisation among fishers<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a> 
as a result of their efforts to overcome their
disadvantages and as a result of support from groups such as the clergy. That support has not
been without its problems because it has, at times, tied the fishers' movements into the broader
agenda of the Church and its allies - although the radicalisation of elements of the clergy have
negated that effect to a considerable extent.

<p>What we can also see is a record of struggle - against wealthier and stronger boat owners
and financial interests; against unresponsive governments and politicians with vested interests
prepared to work against them; against brutal police forces - which stands in line with the
struggles of India's poorest peasants and <em>dalits</em> against oppression, exploitation and attempts to
take away even the small basis of livelihood that they have bolster, in the name of 'development'
and 'reform' to serve capitalist interests.

'Fishing and fish trade are universally relegated to low caste men who alike from their want of

the most ignorant, suspicious and prejudiced of the population, extremely averse to changing the
methods of their forefathers and almost universally without the financial resources necessary for
the adoption of new methods, even when convinced of their value.' Such views had developed
earlier; see, e.g., Dr B. Sundara Raj, Director of the Madras Fisheries Department who explained
that of deep-sea fisheries would only develop through government endeavour: 'Especially is this
the case in India where the fisherfolk are among the poorest and most backward communities and
are utterly lacking in outlook, initiative and capital. [Even though they are] the sector of the
population who will most immediately benefit from it they are too ignorant and illiterate to
