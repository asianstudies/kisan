<p><strong><a name="swam">
The Swami</a></strong>

<p>	The foremost of the leaders of the peasantry in Bihar was 
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Misc/Sss/sahaj.html">
Swami
Sahajanand Saraswati</a>.  Sahajanand was born in Ghazipur district in
eastern U.P. in the late nineteenth century (1889?) [Sahajanand,
1952] to a family of Jujautia Brahmins.  He was the last of six sons
and had no sisters.  His mother died when he was a child and Naurang
Rai (as he was known then) was raised by an aunt.  His father, Beni
Rai, although a Brahmin, was primarily a cultivator, and was so
divorced from priestly functions that he did not even know the
gayatri mantras.  The family held a small zamindari, income from
which had sufficed in Sahajanand's grandfathers' time, but as the
family grew and the land was partitioned, prosperity dwindled and
(tenant) cultivation became the main occupation.  However, the family
was not so extremely poor that its condition would prevent Naurang
from going to school, where he did very well both in the primary
grades and in the German Mission high school where he studied
English.  Even at an early age, however, Naurang showed sings of
brilliance and scepticism of conventional populist religious
practices.  He questioned the institution of people taking guru-
mantra from fake religious personages and wanted to study religious
texts deeply in order to be able to find real spiritual solace by
renouncing the world.  To prevent him from doing this, his family had
him married to a child bride but, before the marriage could stablise,
in 1905 or early 1906, his wife died.  The last fetter in his way to
sanyas (renunciation of the world) having been removed, in 1907
Naurang Rai was initiated into holy orders and took on the name of
Swami Sahajanand Saraswati.  This adoption of sanyas prevented him
from appearing for the matriculation examination but he spent the
rest of his life, especially the first seven years after sanyas, in
studying religion, politics and social affairs.  In all these he
became increasingly radicalised so that towards the end of his life,
the world was presented with the incongruous sight of a saffron-clad
swami who denounced organised religion 
[<a href="#s48">Sahajanand, 1948</a>:96-123].

<p>	However, before Sahajanand came to this stage, he had to
traverse a long road.  His first involvement in public activity
started from the very narrow casteist Bhumihar platform.  Only
gradually did Sahajanand become involved in nationalist Congress
politics, and then in peasant movements, progressively in Patna,
Bihar and, finally, all over India. 

<p>	Even in order to get to the peasant question, however,
Sahajanand went through political schooling in Congress under Gandhi. 
In fact, the Swami and the Mahatma had a curious filial relationship. 
Sahajanand started off in Congress as a devoted Gandhian, admiring
Gandhi's fusion of tradition, religion and politics and, by 1920,
threw himself into the nationalist movement as directed by Gandhi. 
However, he first became disgusted with the petty, comfort-seeking
hypocrisy of the self-proclaimed `Gandhians' especially in jail and,
within 15 years, he was disillusioned with Gandhi's own ambiguity and
devious pro-propertied attitudes.  The final break came in 1934 after
Bihar had been violently shaken by the great earthquake of that year. 
During the relief operations in which Sahajanand was deeply involved,
he came across many cases where, in spite of the destruction
perpetrated by the natural calamity, he found the suffering of the
people to be less on account of the earthquake than as the result of
the cruelty of the landlords in rent collection.  When Sahajanand
found no way of tackling this situation, he went to meet Gandhi, who
was then camping at Patna, to ask for advice.  Gandhi sanguinely told
him, `The zamindars will remove the difficulties of the peasants. 
Their managers are Congressmen.  So they will definitely help the
poor' [<a href="#s52">Sahajanand, 1952</a>:426].  In spite of this, the oppression of
the peasantry by the `zamindari machinery including Congressmen
managers' continued.  These platitudes of Gandhi disgusted Sahajanand
and he broke off his 14 year association with the Mahatma.  After
that, he consistently saw the Mahatma as a wily politician who, in
order to defend the propertied classes, took recourse in
pseudo-spiritualism, professions of non-violence and religious
hocus-pocus.

<p>	After his break with Gandhi, Sahajanand kept out of party
politics (though he continued to be a member of the Congress) and
turned his energies into mobilising the peasants [<a href="#h61">Hauser,
1961</a>:109-133].  By the end of the decade, he emerged as the foremost
kisan leader in India.  In this task of organising the peasants, at
different times his political impetuosity took him close to different
individuals, parties and groups.  He first joined hands with the
Congress Socialists for the formation of the All-India Kisan Sabha;
then with Subhas Chandra Bose organised the Anti-Compromise
Conference against the British and the Congress [<a href="#s40">Sahajanand, 1940</a>];
then worked with the CPI during the Second World War [<a href="#d81">Das, 1981</a>]; and
finally broke from them, too, to form an `independent' Kisan Sabha
[<a href="#r46">Rai, 1946</a>].  In spite of these political forays, however, Sahajanand
remained essentially a non-party man and his loyalty was only to the
peasants for whom he was the most articulate spokesman and forthright
leader.  As a peasant leader, `by standards of speech and action, he
was unsurpassed' [<a href="#h61">Hauser, 1961</a>:85].  He achieved that status by a
remarkable ability to speak to and for the peasants of Bihar; he
could communicate with them and articulate their feelings in terms
whose meaning neither peasant nor politicians could mistake.  `He was
relentlessly determined to improve the peasants' condition and
pursued that objective with such force and energy that he was almost
universally loved by the peasants, and almost equally both respect
and feared by the landlords, Congressmen and officials.  The Swami
was a militant agitator; he sought to expose the condition of
agrarian society and to organise the peasants massively to achieve
change.  He did this through countless meetings and rallies which he
organised and which he addressed in his own inimitable forthright
manner.  He was a powerful speaker speaking the language of the
peasants.  Sahajanand was a <em>Dandi Sanyasi</em> and always carried a long
bamboo staff (<em>danda</em>).  In the course of the movement, this staff
became the symbol of peasant resistance.  They cry of "<em>Danda Mera
Zindabad</em>" (Long live my staff), was thus taken to mean "Long live the
<em>danda</em> (<em>lathi</em>) of the Kisans" and it became the watchword of the Bihar
peasant movement.  The inevitable response by the masses of peasants
was "<em>Swamiji ki Jai</em>" (Victory to Swamiji) [<a href="#h61">Hauser, op cit</a>].  <em>"Kaise
Logey Malguzari, Latth Hamara Zindabad"</em>  (How will you collect rent
as long as our sticks are powerful?) became the battle cry of the
peasants. 

<p>	This was the manner in which a common communication was
achieved.  And it was vastly enhanced by the fact that Sahajanand was
a Swami, which gave him a tremendous charisma.  In 1937, he was
reported to have said that as religious robes had long exploited the
peasants, now he would exploit those robes on behalf of the peasants'
[<a href="#h61">Hauser, ibid</a>]. When landlords raised the question as to how a
sanyasi (mendicant) was taking part in temporal problems of the poor,
Sahajanand quoted the scriptures at them:

<p><em>Prayen deva munayah swavimukti kama</em>

<p><em>Maunam charanti vijane na pararthnsihthah</em>

<p><em>Naitan vihaya kripnan vimumuksha eko</em>

<p><em>Nanyattwadasya sharanam bhramato nupashye</em>

<p>(Mendicants are selfish, living away from society, they try for their
own salvation without caring for others.  I cannot do that, I do not
want my own salvation apart from that of the many destitutes.  I will
stay with them, live with them and die with them)[<a href="#s52">Sahajanand,
1952</a>:171].


<p>	Such was Swami Sahajanand Saraswati, the charismatic sanyasi
rebel, who laid the foundations of kisan organisation in Bihar, built
it up into a massive movement, spread it to other parts of India and
radicalised it to such an extent that what had started off as a move
to bring about reform in the zamindari system, ended up by destroying
the system itself.  Sahajanand could not, however,m witness the legal
death of zamindari in BIhar.  While the battle for this was still
being fought in the legislature and the courts, on 26 June 1950,
Sahajanand passed away [<a href="#su73">Sudhakar, 1973</a>:14].


<p><strong><a name="orga">The Organisation</a></strong>

<p>	Swami Sahajanand Saraswati was, of course,  a fascinating
personality but what also added immense social significance to him
was the fact that he was able to found a massive organisation. This
took a great deal of both imagination and effort and the fact that it
has had a turbulent history is evidence of the role of the individual
as well as the relevance of the political-economic context. 

<p>	Although the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha was formed in 1929
and a smaller Kisan Sabha had been formed even earlier in Patna
district with a formal organisational structure, it really was
institutionalised only after a few years.  Actually, it is correct to
say that the Kisan Sabha never really became an `organisation', but
remained a movement [<a href="#h61">Hauser, 1961</a>:87].  

<p>	But if that is so for the whole of the history of the Sabha, in
its first years it was even more nebulous: an idea, a forum, a
propaganda platform, a lobby.  Almost immediately after the formation
of the Sabha Bihar was plunged, with the rest of India, into the
Civil Disobedience Movement, which, although it helped in arousing
the general consciousness of the masses, did not give the leaders of
the Sabha the time to formalise its structure [<a href="#w33">Williams, 1933</a>:1- 30]. 
In fact, the experiences of the Civil Disobedience Movement both
outside and inside jails created the beginnings of the rift between
the Kisan Sabhaites and some of the Congress leaders [<a href="#b33">BSCRO:21/1933</a>],
and so disgusted the supreme leader of the Sabha, Swami Sahajanand
Saraswati, that for several years he cut  himself off from politics
altogether [<a href="#s52">Sahajanand, 1952</a>:373-381].

<p>	But while, because of these problems, the Kisan Sabha remained
disorganised, the landlords recognised its potentially dangerous
character.  In order to meet its challenge and to consolidate their
position, they organised themselves and their supporters into three
main bodies.  The first was a clearcut Bihar Landholders' Association
which included within it all the prominent zamindars.  The second was
a more clever attempt to hide the organisation's basic class
character; it was called the United Party and was supposed to
represent the interests of various sections of the population.  It
even included a few Congressmen though its leadership was composed of
the leading landlords, including the Maharajadhiraj of Darbhanga and
the Raja of Surajpura.  Having failed in their first attempt in
1928-29 to get the Tenancy Act amended, the landlords tried to do so
through this United Party.  Rai Bahadur Shyamnandan Sahay, one of the
richest zamindars of Bihar, accordingly drew up a new tenancy bill
with the obvious intention of strengthening the zamindars' position
by giving them more powers.  However, in order to achieve a semblance
of zamindar-tenant unity in presenting the new legislation, the
United Party conspired to develop a compromise measure by forming a
`Kisan Sabha' which held its meeting at Patna early in 1933
[<a href="#sa43">Sankrityayana, 1943</a>:112].  Ironically, it was this effort of the
landholders which brought Sahajanand back into politics and vastly
strengthened the Kisan Sabha [<a href="#su73">Sudhakar, 1973</a>:9].

<p>	There was no unanimity among Congressmen about their approach
to the Untied Party and its `Kisan Sabha'.  While leaders like
Rajendra Prasad felt that as an election trick the United Party was
doomed to failure, they also thought it might actually gain some
concessions for the peasantry.  Hence they felt opposition to the
United Party was `unnecessary'.  Some other Congress leaders thought
otherwise:

<p>	My colleagues were agitated thinking that (an amended
tenancy law) would increase the new party's influence
among the peasants.  They wanted the move to be opposed,
but most of the Congressmen were in prison and the
organisation was banned and could not do anything.  They
thought, therefore, of reviving the dormant Kisan Sabha. 
Word was passed on to Swami Sahajanand to activise the
Kisan Sabha and expose the United Party's move...  I felt
that all this was unnecessary but, as I could not oppose
it, kept quiet. [<a href="#p57">Prasad, 1957</a>:361].

<p>	

<p>	Sahajanand was apprised of the `bogus Kisan Sabha' and its proposed session at Patna by Yadunandan Sharma and induced by him to
attend the meeting.  After much hesitation about re-entering
politics, Sahajnand agreed and made a dramatic entry in the Patna
meeting which was being conducted by such well-known zamindars and
their henchmen as Dr Sachidanand Sinha (the `Founder Modern Bihar')
and Guru Sahay Lal (later President of the Bihar Chamber of
Commerce).  The Swami's unexpected presence caused considerable
embarrassment to the sponsors of the meeting and his forthright stand
there condemning such devious manoeuverings marked the end of the
effort by the zamindars to play politics through the use of the name
of the Kisan Sabha.  At the same time, this abortive attempt proved
that even the zamindars had recognised the potential of an
organisation like the Kisan Sabha even though until then it was no
more than a name.  Recognising that even the name spelled powerful
magic for the Kisans, Sahajanand decided to organise the Sabha.

<p>	In spite of the efforts of Swami Sahajanand in the direction of
giving the Kisan Sabha a live but formal organisational structure, it
remained more a movement than an organisation.  However, after 1934,
the movement was, in a way, institutionalised though its primary
instruments of operation continued to by numerous meetings, rallies,
`struggles' and annual conventions rather than paper-work.  This was
a reflection of the impatient leadership of Sahajanand which, in
spite of resolutions to the contrary, was not basically concerned
with the formal niceties of organisation.  While the agitational
character marked the movement as necessarily transitory in nature, it
also provided it with an element of spontaneous strength.  While the
Congress relied on its organisational character for mobilising the
people for its movements, the Kisan Sabha drew its organisational
vitality from the different movements and struggles.  And, for the
time being at least, the Kisan Sabha's mode of working was more
effective.  Even the officials remarked that the `Kisan Sabha touches
the ryot more directly and its meetings are larger than the Congress'
[<a href="#b35">BSCRO:16/1935</a>].

<p>	But Sahajanand also recognised and emphasised the need for
organisation of the peasants, except that organisation to him meant
organisation of mass action rather than a fossilised hierarchy of
constitutional formalities:

<p>	You must speak in great numbers.  Government officials are
here and when you come in tens of thousands they will
listen, otherwise they will think you need nothing because
you are silent.  In Gaya there were 50,000 kisans and it
caused a furore...  We do not teach you to assault
zamindars, only to get what is your right.  We do not seek
to create trouble between zamindars and tenants.  The
Government, zamindars and capitalists are strong.  I want
you to be strong too and the way to do it is to hold
meetings.  If you do not organise and hold Kisan Sabhas,
troubles will not end [<a href="#b35i">BSCRO:16/1935/I)</a>].


<p>	The formal organisational structure of the movement was
expressed through the Rules of 1929 and the Constitution framed in
1936.  The 1936 Constitution served as the official statement of
organisation form and objectives which included the winning of the
`fundamental rights' of the peasants [<a href="#bi36">BPKS, 1936</a>].  It also outlined
the rules and procedures for membership and other organisational
details.  All peasants were admitted as members of the Kisan Sabha
with a membership fee reduced from two annas (Rs.0.12) to one price
(Rs.0.015) in 1936.  The basis of organisation was the village, or
gram Kisan Sabha, electing representatives to thana Kisan Sabhas,
which similarly elected members to the district body which in turn
elected members of the Provincial Kisan Sabha.  The executive organ
of each of these bodies was the Kisan Council, elected by respective
memberships.  In the case of the Provincial Kisan Sabha, the Kisan
Council comprised 15 members including officer-bearers who were
specifically designated as a president, secretary and two joint
secretaries.  However, in practice there was considerable variation,
with an increase in the number of joint secretaries normally to cover
regional areas and often there were also some vice-presidents.  These
offices were all held for an annual term but a treasurer was elected
to serve `until it was thought necessary to change him'.  Income was
derived from membership fees and from small levies on the members of
various councils, with funds divided between local and provincial
bodies.  Provision was made for annual sammelans, or conventions of
the several bodies of the Kisan Sabha with a president elected for
such conferences.  it was indicated that reports of the provincial
sammelans were to be printed.

<p>	In practice, the formal organisation of the movement was
confined to the activities of the Provincial Kisan Council and the
annual provincial sammelan, though, on an irregular basis, sammelans
at other levels were also held.  In addition, a secretary was active
for the period of 1935 to 1940 and an office was maintained at the
Bihta ashram of Swami Sahajanand.  In very large measure, the Swami
himself co-ordinated much of the work of the Provincial Kisan Sabha
when it was formed. 

<p>	The membership of the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha was
estimated at 80,000 in 1935 and the figure for 1938 was placed at
upwards of 250,000, which made it by far the largest such provincial
body in India.  However, these and all other membership figures can
be taken as no more than approxzimations.  Verification is extremely
difficult in the absence of any other data as a basis of comparison. 
The one possible measure of activity and an indication of
participation, if not of membership, is to be derived from the press
and official estimates of local meetings and provincial rallies.  At
the height of the agitation, Sahajanand consistently addressed local
village meetings of up to 5000 peasants, and the estimates of peasant
rallies in Patna were commonly as high as or even higher than
100,000.

<p>	With the formation of the All-India Kisan Sabha at LUcknow in
April 1936,  the Bihar Kisan Sabha became one of the provincial units
of that national body.  The Congress Socialist Party pressed for the
organisation of an all-India peasant association, and N.G. Ranga
[<a href="#r49">1949:</a>69; <a href="#r68">1968</a>:216] 
became a prime mover in the effort.  While
Sahajanand was named president of the first meeting at Lucknow, he
had come to support the idea reluctantly, holding that a national
organisation could function effectively only on the basis of a
network of well-developed provincial bodies, which did not in fact
exist [<a href="#s52">Sahajanand, 1952</a>:449-453].  
While Sahajanand, once involved,
extended total support, and to a large extent created and maintained
the organisational framework by his own efforts, the A.I.K.S.
suffered from the very shortcomings he had indicated: there was
insufficient local depth to sustain a national movement [<a href="#m38">Mitra,
1938</a>:387-389].


<p><strong><a name="move">The Movements</a></strong>

<p>	The Kisan Sabha may have faltered in finding its feet in other
parts of India, but in Bihar, from its very inception, it was
involved in strong movements both based on and in turn generating
mass enthusiasm for it.  Its very foundation in 1929 was marked by
the dropping of the proposed tenancy amendment.  This was construed
by the peasants as a significant victory and proved to be a
tremendous morale-booster for them.  On the heels of this came the
Civil Disobedience Movement; and the Great Depression; and Provincial
Autonomy; and the Second World War; and the Quit India Movement. 
And, finally, Independence.  The Kisan Sabha grew from strength to
strength on the crest of these waves of stirring political and
economic events.

<p>	No earlier political campaign in India had fired the
imagination of the rural population and become inter-twined with
agrarian issues, as the Civil Disobedience Movement of the first few
years of the 1930s did.  The simple and yet deep issues behind the
agitation and the innovative methods of struggle -- illegal
manufacture of salt, boycott of government officials, non- payment of
taxes, mass courting of arrests, campaign against foreign cloth,
liquor and chowkidary levies, combined with boycott of courts,
schools and colleges -- mobilised the vast forces of the agrarian
population in unison with the urban masses.  The campaign became so
intense as well as wide-spread that an official view was that `The
political history of 1930-31 is... a tale of constant agitation, and
of the measures taken by the government to combat this dangerous
movement.  In the "war"... which resulted, there were frequent and
sometimes serious clashes between the forces of law and order and
those of unrest...'[<a href="#m32">Mansfield, 1932</a>:1].  While the movement erupted
most vigorously in the towns, the villages, too, were so seriously
involved that the government and `loyalists' has to set up `Aman
Sabhas' (Peace Councils) in rural areas to utilise the traditional
local hold of zamindars to keep the tenants from rebelling against
the State.  These Aman Sabhas succeeded here and there in restraining
the peasantry but in many part of rural Bihar, `police parties and
other government officials were attached by mobs of villagers who
threatened to murder them'.  `In Bhagalpur, a regular camp (of
peasant activists) had been started at Bihpur, where volunteers were
lodged in barracks and were taught drill and lathi play, the whole
routine being regulated by bugle call'.  [<a href="#m32">Ibid</a>:2-3].  Alarmed at this
type of mass upsurge combined with the anger of people over the
hanging of Bhagat Singh and his comrades, `the Government of India
attempted to secure the goodwill of Mr Gandhi and the Congress Party
and their cooperation in the work of making a durable constitutional
settlement' [<a href="#w33">Williams, 1933</a>:12]. However, even the Gandhi-Irwin Pact
did not pacify the aroused people.  In the urban areas it did have
some effect because `the cities and the middle classes were a bit
tired of the hartals and processions' [<a href="#n36">Nehru, 1936</a>:232].  But  for
the villages `the Delhi settlement instead of pacifying... stimulated
the forces of disorder' [<a href="#w33">Williams, 1933</a>:3-4].  These forces of
disorder were taken by a section of the Congress leadership to be the
factor which `was needed to liven things up, a fresh infusion of
blood... where could this come from except from the peasantry -- and
the reserve stocks there were enormous'.  [<a href="#n36">Nehru, 1936</a>].  The
peasants, the `reserve stocks' of the nationalist movement, did not
belie the expectations of the leaders.  With tremendous enthusiasm
they jumped into the fray and the Civil Disobedience Movement for a
while became a `festival of the masses':

<p>	A sense of rivalry prevailed in the countryside.  Every
village wanted to have the honour of getting the largest
number of people arrested ... None broke the law
clandestinely because it was an open Satyagraha.  During
my tour of the countryside I often saw the villagers
gather in open places decorated with buntings and plantain
leaves and manufacture salt with great ceremony [<a href="#p57">Prasad,
1957</a>:312; <a href="#d96">Das, 1996</a>].


<p>	But the movement did not remain at the level of ceremonies: the
peasants translated the movement into their own terms and that
greatly disconcerted not only the government and the loyalist
zamindars but even a section of the Congress leaders.  Jawaharlal
Nehru [<a href="#n36">op.cit.</a>] had foreseen this.  With the participation of the
peasantry, the campaign, he said, `would again become a mass movement
touching the vital interests of the masses, and, what was to me very
important, would raise social issues'.  These social issues were
raised by transforming the no-tax campaign into a no-rent movement. 
The movement in Bihar did not reach the proportions of the extensive
campaign in the United Provinces and, in fact, in Bihar it developed
in such a manner that in practice the zamindars tried to camouflage
its seriousness by paying their revenue in most cases while the
tenantry desisted from the payment of rent.  In fact neither the
government nor the zamindars took any drastic action, except in
isolated cases, to terrorise the recalcitrant tenantry for several
months because:

<p>	They were not sure of their grounds, as they had the
political struggle with civil disobedience on the one
side, and the economic slump, resulting in agricultural
distress on the other.  The two merged into each other,
and the Government was always afraid of an agrarian
upheaval [<a href="#n36">Nehru, 1936</a>:237].


<p>	Such, indeed, was the actual or potential threat of this
no-rent movement in U.P. that rent was reduced there to the 1901
level although officials felt that this action was `entirely contrary
to the terms of the permanent settlement' and `not in the least
justifiable' [<a href="#b31">BSCRO:34/1931</a>].  Nevertheless, the rent reduction
conceded was substantial, varying between five to eight annas
(Rs.0.31 to Rs.0.50) in the rupee in Benaras division and thus, while
it did not fully come to grips with agrarian problem it did temper
the prospect of a `peasant rising' and `agrarian upheaval'.

<p>	Despite this example of the `victory' of the U.P. peasantry,
however, Congress leaders in Bihar did not press for rent and revenue
remissions, nor in fact did they show much enthusiasm for the radical
declarations made at the Karachi session of the Congress.  This was
because, by and large, the Congress leaders in Bihar were `Gandhians'
rather than `Nehru-ites'.  Gandhi himself had much earlier made his
position clear:

<p>	While we will not hesitate to advise the Kisans, when the
movement comes, to suspend payment of taxes of the
Government, it is not contemplated that at any stages of
non-cooperation we would seek to deprive the zamindars of
their rent.  The Kisan movement must be confined to the
improvement of the status of the Kisans and the betterment
of the relations between the zamindars and them. [<a href="#g21">Gandhi,
1921</a>]. 


<p>	Even Nehru recognised that there were different opinions among
Congressmen on this issue and tried to work out a method in which
both the zamindars and tenants could be involved in the movement:

<p>	If the tenants stopped paying their rents the landlords
suffered immediately.  A class issue was also thus raised. 
The Congress, as a whole, was a purely nationalist body,
and included many middling zamindars and a few of the
larger ones also.  Its leaders were terribly afraid of
doing anything which might raise this class issue or
irritate the zamindar elements.  So, right through the
first six months of civil disobedience, they avoided
calling for a general no-tax campaign in the rural areas,
although conditions for this seemed to me to be ripe.  I
was not afraid of raising the class issue in this way or
any other way, but I recognised that the Congress, being
what it was, could not then patronise class conflict.  It
could, however, call upon both parties, zamindars and
tenants not to pay [<a href="#n36">Nehru, 1936</a>:232]. 


<p>	The desire to avoid class conflict prevented Congress from
taking a consistent line.  While in U.P., under the leadership of
Jawaharlal Nehru, it backed the no-rent campaign, in Bihar `the
landlord element in the Congress camp decided against a no-rent
campaign; the "dictator": advised the tenants to cultivate good
relations with their landlords, and Congress diverted its energies
well-tried channels of agitation.  Its chief objects pending Mr
Gandhi's return from England was the collection of funds and the
enrolling of volunteers' [<a href="#w33">Williams, 1933</a>.6-9].  The radical
declarations were reduced to empty verbiage and the officials smugly
remarked:

<p>	The revolutionary creed enunciated by the Congress at
Karachi provoked little comment and less sympathy.  Such
a charger could not appeal to the class of petty
landowners from which many of the provincial Congress
leaders were recruited.  Their self-interest recoiled from
the prospect of conducting a campaign against the payment
of rents which in most parts of the settled districts of
Bihar amount to ten times the land revenue [<a href="#w33">Williams,
1933</a>:5]. 


<p>	In spite of the waverings of the leaders, however, the peasants
did agitate in their own manner and even the officials were
constrained to record that `the lawless spirit born of civil
disobedience was always liable to drive dissatisfied tenants to
violence when a dispute occurred between them and the
landlords'[<a href="#w33">Williams, 1933</a>:32].  This also led the tenants to agitate
militantly on agrarian issues and organise themselves into Kisan
Sabhas.  Kisan Sabhas were formed in Patna, Gaya, Monghyr (where
three village officials were killed by irate tenants), Champaran
(where the Bettiah estate, under the Court of Wards, tried to contain
peasant anger by granting concessions) and Palamau where `the genuine
grievances of the raiyats gave new life to the local Kisan Sabha, but
agitators used the opportunity to preach the non-payment of rent and
chaukidari tax, the wholesale cutting down of the jungle, and
physical resistance to the landlords' agents' [<a href="#w39">Williams, 1939</a>:9-16]. 
In addition, `orators toured Bihar making violent speeches.  Large
number of volunteers, mainly loafers and unemployed persons were
collected in (rural) training camps in the Muzaffarpur,  Champaran,
Saran and Manbhum districts and gave displays to impress the public'
[<a href="#w39">Ibid</a>:10].  The `public' may or may not have been impressed by this
display of force by the lumpen proletariat and the peasantry but the
Civil Disobedience movement did affect the kisans themselves in terms
of arousing their consciousness.  Even Sahajanand, who had kept
himself aloof from the movement for a large part [<a href="#h61">Hauser, 1961</a>:61],
observed:

<p>	The Satyagraha ... brought unprecedented awakening among
the Kisans.  The result was that their problems also came
to the forefront.  They had sacrificed their utmost at the
behest of the Congress...  However could these (Congress)
leaders... neglect them when they had to utilise the
Kisans in the coming struggle? [<a href="#s52">Sahajanand, 1952</a>:327-377].


<p>	In spite of their largely pro-landlord bias, even the
provincial Congress leaders knew that they could not neglect the
peasants.  Besides, the peasants themselves by their repeated
militant actions were drawing attention towards their plight and were
giving indication that if nothing was done soon to ameliorate their
condition, matters would go out of the hands of the Congress leaders. 
In order to control this peasant anger as well as to give an
impression of doing things for the kisans, the Bihar Provincial
Congress Committee (BPCC) decided to investigate the conditions of
peasants in Gaya district.  This was in 1931.  Up to this day (1997!)
no report has been prepared nor was any statement issued to the press
after the investigation.  The BPCC Enquiry Committee, under the
chairmanship of Rajendra Prasad, toured extensively and took copious
evidence from the villagers but `its findings resulted in no
recommendations for change, beyond seeking the reconciliation of
landlord-tenant differences' [<a href="#h61">Hauser, 1961</a>:51].  In fact, some
government officials saw in the activities of the Congress Enquiry
Committee and the tours of prominent leaders, a specific effort to
disabuse the peasants of the belief that Gandhi's Civil Disobedience
Movement and the then economic dislocation (Great Depression) were
somehow related (BSCRO:34/1931].

<p>	The very failure of the BPCC's Enquiry Committee to come up
with a report, however, resulted in highlighting the plight of the
kisans of Gaya.  For, in order to do the work the Congress had not
done, in 1933 the Bihar Provincial Kisan Council appointed a
Committee to inquire into the problems of the peasants and to publish
a report.  The five-member committee consisted of Sahajanand, Yamuna
Karjee, Yadunandan Sharma, Yugal Kishore Singh and Badri Narain
Singh.  This committee also investigated the conditions by
extensively interviewing peasants and published its findings in the
form of a pamphlet prepared by Sahajanand [<a href="#s-f">Sahajanand,-f</a>].

<p>	Sahajanand's damning indictment of conditions in Gaya drew two
sorts of reactions from the government.  While one lot of officials
felt that `Kisan Sabhas established in Patna and Gaya districts were
never a source of danger' [<a href="#w33">Williams, 1933</a>:9], although Sahajanand was
`a dangerous individual engaged in a sinister conspiracy to set up
the cultivator against the landlord and initiate a `Communist Revolt'
on the Russian model ' [<a href="#h61">Hauser, 1961</a>:97], on the other hand there was
more sober assessment in the admission by various administrators that
Sahajanand's case was strong and based on a solid substratum of
fact'.  A member of the Bihar Executive Council admitted that the
Swami was `clever and (had) justification for a great deal of what he
said' [<a href="#b34">BSCRO: 163/1934</a>], while a local official observed that
Sahajanand was `genuine in his work for the ryots' and drew attention
to facts which `really need investigation' [<a href="#b35">BSCRO:16/1935</a>].  The
government launched such an investigation, and concluded that Sahajanand's charges were essentially true.  It was admitted that in
matters of receipts and rent reduction the law favoured the zamindar
and the courts, which in any case were out of reach of the tenant,
also joined in opposing him; that kisans were subjected to
`harassment and illegal exactions'; that the conditions of bhaoli
(produce rent) tenants were worst `as they cannot take a grain of
crops without the zamindar's consent'; and that commented rents were
excessive and squeezed the tenant in the case of fall in prices. 
Only on the questions of canal rates and upkeep of irrigation
facilities did the investigating officer (the District Collector)
differ with the Kisan Sabha report.  He concluded significantly that
the tenants knew their difficulties, `only they do not know the
remedy' [<a href="#b34">BSCRO: 163/1934]</a>. 

<p>	Not that the government knew the remedy.  It `felt that nothing
could be done about any of these matters and that the legislative
council in any event would not agree to strengthening the law to the
detriment of the majority of its zamindar members.  In apparent good
faith the Governor periodically called together deputations of
Zamindars urging on them the establishment of goodwill with their
tenants' [<a href="#h61">Hauser, 1961</a>:98].  This was an oft-repeated and
oft-neglected plea.

<p>	But one thing that all the three enquiries revealed was that
the issue was no longer capable of being decided merely by political
or administrative policy-decision.  Economic forces had taken the
stage decisively and they created their own dynamic.  The Great
Depression was on.


<p><strong><a name="econ">The Economic Context</a></strong>

<p>	In spite of the generally backward conditions obtaining then,
during the first half of the 19th century agriculture did show some
progress in Bihar.  The vast increase in poppy and opium cultivation,
which was enforced by the British, necessitated the reclamation of
vast tracts and the colonial government settled land on many of its
faithful retainers in North and Central BIhar [<a href="#m80">Mitra, 1980</a>].  This
made further reclamation necessary.  The potato, a new crop in Bihar,
was introduced during this period and although it was not very
popular in the beginning, subsequently it became one of the more
important cash crops in the region [<a href="#d57">Diwakar, 1957</a>].  A very small
number of minor irrigation measures were also undertaken during this
period in Central Bihar [<a href="#c76">Chaudhuri, 1976]</a>.

<p>	However, much of the gain was offset by the other effects of
colonialism.  The de-industrialiasation, and possible de-
urbanisation, which followed in the wake of the large-scale
importation of factory-made goods from England, were factors which
increased the pressure on land and consequently long-term
pauperisation in the countryside [<a href="#ba76">Bagchi, 1976</a>].  Similarly, the
emphasis on the cultivation of the poppy and later indigo was
directly linked with British colonial trade and in fact hindered the
development of food grain production.  The fact that the local
industrial sector could not develop at a sufficiently fast pace
hindered the progress of the production of even some `cash crops'. 
For instance, although in the second half of the 19th century, jute
was grown in Purnea in fairly large quantities and in Tirhut to some
extent, no thought was given to the establishment of jute mills in
these areas.  The enormous import of foreign sugar prevented the
development of a local sugar industry to the extent that between
1892-93 and 1910-11 the area under sugar-cane decreased by about 20
per cent [<a href="#d57">Diwakar, 1957</a>].

<p>	The result was that while the food-crop sector of Bihar's
agriculture continued for a long time to exist in a relatively
non-commercial, subsistence set-up under conditions of rack- renting,
corvee and heavy indebtedness of the peasantry, the cash-crop sector
was tied not to the operations of the Bihar, or even the Indian,
market but to the colonial market mechanism.  The fluctuations in
prices and even the acreage under these crops were determined not by
the forces of supply and demand of the indigenous market but of the
British economy.  For instance, the acreage under sugar-cane fell
noticeably during the years of the First World War (1914-18) due
apparently to a good proportion of the land being transferred to
indigo.  But after 1920 there was a swing of the pendulum, and by
1922 the sugar industry was fairly well established in Bihar, the
state having nearly 30 factories by 1947.  Similarly, the First World
War noticeably reduced the export of cereals from India.  But Bihar
was not affected by this because it exported little rice or wheat,
though it ranked next to Bengal in rice production.  Agricultural
production on the whole showed an upward trend after 1918-19.  But
before conditions could improve very greatly, the world-wide Great
Depression set in towards the middle of 1929 and the plight of poor
agriculturists during the next 12 years was deplorable.  Prices,
however, began to shoot up during 1942-43, thanks to inflation during
the Second World War [<a href="#d57">Diwakar, 1957</a>], and this caused acute distress
among the landless rural and urban population and the poor peasantry
with chronically deficit family budgets, while the conditions of the
landowners -- the zamindars, the landlord- capitalists and the
peasant-capitalists -- improved somewhat.  The ready availability of
money, during and immediately after the Second World War, made this
class fairly contented.

<p>	It is obvious from these that even such commercialisation as
took place in Bihar's agriculture was not due to the inherent
dynamics of the agrarian system, but was dependent on exogenous
factors just as even the depeasatisation taking place in the
countryside was not of immediate effect locally: the labour drawn
from agriculture was largely siphoned off on indenture to various
parts of the world, to Assam tea plantations and the city of
Calcutta, and thus set off a process which has been characterised as
`external proletarinisation' [<a href="#sind">Singh, n.d.</a>], a phenomenon that
continues till today.

<p>	In spite of this emigration of labour, however, there was a
continuous process of peasants losing land or being immiserised.  For
instance, even between 1931 and 1951 only 50 per cent of the natural
increase in population could be absorbed in non-agricultural
occupations in Bihar and the percentage of population dependent on
agriculture increased from 78.8 in 1931 to 87.3 in 1951 [<a href="#b52">Bihar,
1952</a>:2].  The result of this was that while agricultural labour
became cheap, the power of the landowners- moneylenders increased. 
Land started going from the ordinary raiyat into the hands of his
creditors.  This process was facilitated by the necessity of the
tenant to borrow in order to pay rents to his zamindar in addition to
the need to meet his ordinary consumption requirements.  At the very
beginning of the Permanent Settlement, in Shahabad and Patna-Gaya,
Buchanan found that the payment of rent, apart from other financial
obligations of the peasants, nearly universally necessitated
borrowing.  In Shahabad the number of `farmers who borrow ready
money' was larger than of the `farmers who take advance on their
crops to pay rent'.  In Patna-Gaya, it was the other way round.  In
either case, the situation was such that the Commissioner of Patna,
Mr Metcalfe, who formed his opinion on the basis of the `impressions
left by the village scenes in moffusil wanderings over a period of 17
years', concluded half a century later that `the agriculturist
regards a village without its money-lender as an abnormal state of
things.' [<a href="#c75">Chaudhuri, 1975</a>].

<p>	The money-lenders' operations varied from time to time,
depending on the situation outside the immediate context of the
village economy.  Fluctuation of prices of agricultural produce
caused by such factors as the World War or the general world economic
depression resulted in changes in the fortunes of money-lenders. 
Nevertheless, the money-lenders and traders made substantial `hay' in
the sunshine of generally rising prices and increased their
activities several-fold.  This was particularly marked in the
economic boom which followed the First World War.  There was a rush
to corner whatever land was available.  Peasants were increasingly
thrown out and money-lenders also turned speculators, going even to
the extent of borrowing themselves in order to buy land.

<p>	And then came the crash.  The decade of the Great Depression
set in.  Many of the money-lenders who had speculated in land were
ruined as land prices plummeted.

<p>	The economic crisis of the late 1920s and 1930s resulted in a
violent fall in the prices of staple food crops.  This in turn
resulted in great hardship for the peasants and in the context of a
general political upheaval created tremendous agrarian torment
leading to the emergence of the Kisan Sabha as a powerful movement.

<p>	From the late nineteenth century until 1922, there was a steady
rise in the price of staple food crops.  Brief exceptions occurred in
1911, 1913 and 1917-18, but from 1922 against the high level remained
steady.  Suddenly, with the depression, prices dropped sharply
reaching the lowest point in 1933 when prices were equivalent to the
1912 level.  Taking the decade 1919-29, the average annual price of
rice is shown to have been from 25 to 48 per cent higher than that of
1938.  In six years prices were over 40 per cent higher than those of
1938, and in only one year, 1923, were prices than 30 per cent above
those of 1938.  The level of the price of maize in this period was
even higher [<a href="#bi38">Bihar, 1938</a>].  It was at that level of prices that
commutation of rents had generally taken place.  In the depressed
price situation of the 1930s, therefore, the rent-price discrepancy
was enormous.  And this discrepancy was reflected in a greatly increased number of rent suits 
[<a href="#bi34">Bihar &amp; Orissa, 1934</a>] and growing
peasant discontent.

<p>	There were many other aspects of the Great Depression, when it
came in 1929 causing a `catastrophic fall in prices of agricultural
produce which began in October and was so rapid that grain was
selling in December at two theirs of the price at which it was sold
a couple of months before... the fall in price did cause difficulty
in the disposal of stocks, and therefore the payment of rent and
cess.  There was a very distinct shortage of money and credit which
got no less acute as time went on' [<a href="#m32">Mansfield, 1932</a>:14].  The low
prices were particularly unfortunate for those whose rents had been
enhanced in the years of high prices, and still more for those who,
holding land on produce rent, had the rents legally commuted to cash
rents in the years when prices were high.  Because of fairly good
crops, there was no actual distress on account of shortage of food,
although the general standard of living fell.  However, the severity
of rent collection did casue hardship.  It is remarkable that
throughout the depression the land revenue collection was almost
always more than 90 per cent of the total demand [<a href="#m32">Mansfield, 1932</a>]
[<a href="#w33">Williams, 1933</a>] <a href="#wi35">Wilcock, 1935</a>] 
[<a href="#so37">Solomon, 1937</a>] [<a href="#na38">Narayan, 1938</a>]
[<a href="#wa38">Wasi, 1938</a>], the bulk of the deficit being in Government estates
`where any default in the payment of rent constitutes ipso facto a
default in the revenue' [<a href="#m32">Mansfield, 1932</a>:80].  In the private
estates, the zamindars showed no remorse in collecting the rents and
were fairly regular in paying the revenue.  Because of those factors,
land prices plummeted: `in the first quarter of 1931 land prices of
raiyati holdings were about two thirds of what they had been in the
first quarter of 1930 [<a href="#m32">Ibid</a>:81].  In 1931 `the rural population of
the province, which accounts for as much as ninety six per cent of
the total population of thirty eight millions, was exposed to the
full effects of the slump in commodity prices' [<a href="#w33">Williams, 1933</a>:20]. 
The depression had a chain effect.  For instance, jute prices fell
along with those of chillies and tobacco.  This caused great distress
in Purnea where these were the chief cash crops.  As a result of
this, the cattle-breeders of Muzaffarpur lost their `export market'
because jute growers of Purnea (and Bengal) had no money to replace
their cattle.  And so on.

<p>	The problems caused by the Great Depression were compounded by
some other factors.  For one thing, nature itself seemed to have
turned against the peasantry of Bihar.  Floods, the perennial problem
of Bihar, wiped out crops in 1934-35 [<a href="#so37">Solomon, 1937</a>:17].  In the
following year, 1935-36, there was drought and, hence, another crop
failure [<a href="#na38">Narayan, 1938</a>:21].  But much more serious than these was the
great earthquake of 1934 [<a href="#wi35">Wilcock, 1935</a>] 
[<a href="#s52">Sahajanand, 1952</a>:421-427]. 
Although expenditure on relieve put some money into circulation, the
damage done to land by sand being thrown up caused severe dislocation
in cultivation and hence agricultural employment.  As a consequence,
agricultural wages were depressed from the already low level and,
combined with the fact that demand for Bihari labour in the
depression-hit industrial and plantation sector outside the province
also became low, tremendous hardship to the lowest strata of the
rural population was caused.  In 1934-35, the government instituted
an enquiry tinto the indebtedness of the cultivators with the special
object of ascertaining whether the situation was deteriorating, and
in particular, to what extent transference of land or crops to
money-lenders was on the increase.  `The result indicated that,
except among improvident aboriginal of Monghyr and Bhagalpur
districts, who had to be protected by special legislation in March
1935, there had been no marked increase in the transfer of land or in
the taking over of crops, chiefly because land and crops fetched, in
the market, prices too low to influence or induce shrewd
money-lenders to lock up their capital in real estate.  This
conclusion is supported by the appreciable increase in the deposits
during the year in the Post Office Savings Banks in the province, in
spite of the earthquake which must have hit a good many persons of
the money-lending middle classes... [<a href="#so37">Solomon, 1937</a>:18-19].  The
peasant, however, was little concerned with increase in Savings Bank
deposits and his condition kept deteriorating.  For, while the
government's enquiry did not disclose any marked increase in rural
indebtedness due to the contraction of new debts, arrears of interest
to money-lenders had kept on increasing.

<p>	While on the one side the economic forces were pushing the
peasants, especially the poorer peasants, against the wall, on the
other the zamindars continued their depredations.  Year after year,
officials reported the exaction of illegal cesses [<a href="#so37">Solomon,
1937</a>:116], refusal by the landlords to accept rents through money
orders [<a href="#j31">Jagmohan, 1931</a>:89], denying tenants receipts for rents paid
by them [<a href="#m32">Mansfield, 1932</a>:82], 
neglect of irrigation system [<a href="#gu34">Gupta,
1934</a>:81], oppression practised by the zamindars, or if they were
absentee landlords, by their amlas, charging of exorbitant salaami
for even distress sale of lands by tenants and so on.  These
practices even in normal times caused agrarian tension and in the
disturbed period of the great depression they proved to be sure
grounds for breeding agrarian unrest.

<p>	This was particularly so because of the peculiar weight of
discrimination in the legal system.  One official who had vast
experience of the working of tenancy laws reported:

<p>	  ... in Bihar... the enforcement of the tenancy laws is
left to the tenants' initiative by way of suit in the
civil courts and the revenue officers are not given an
opportunity to stop illegal acts which are feared to be
only too prevalent...	The tenancy law permits the
landlord to file a suit in the courts for the enhancement
of the rent due from a tenant...  The enhancement, if
allowed, continued in force for fifteen years.  The law
also lays down that the court shall not decree any
enhancement which is unfair or inequitable.  During the
1930(s) there was an appreciable increase in the number of
these suits filed in Bihar and in spite of the falling
prices the courts were inclined to allow enhancements
according to a mechanical rule which overlooked the
cultivator's lower purchasing power...  To ignore the
economic changes of the last few years clearly... (was)...
to render the money value of the proportion left to the
tenant as low as to involve serious hardship [<a href="#w33">Williams,
1933</a>:29-30].


<p>	This blindness of the courts to economic realities, along with
the continuing exploitation and oppression by the zamindars, left the
tenants no avenue other than to organise themselves into Kisan Sabhas
and launch agrarian movements.


<p><strong><a name="ideo">Ideology and Programmes</a></strong>

<p>	The experiences of the various struggles taught the leaders of
the Kisan Sabha much.  When the Sabha was started, the approach  was
admittedly `class collaborationist' [<a href="#s-e">Sahajanand, -el]</a>.  There was
even confusion about the definition of `peasants'.  The earliest
constitutional document of the Kisan Sabha defined a peasant as
anyone whose primary source of livelihood was agriculture and even
the more elaborate constitution of the BPKS in 1936 said essentially
the same thing [<a href="#bp36">BPKS, 1936</a>; <a name="bp-a">BPKS, -a</a>].  
In the introduction of the
Hindi edition of the Manifesto of the BPKS, written by Swami
Sahajanand, the agricultural labourer for the first time was
considered as a peasant, with an agricultural labourer for the first
time was considered as a peasant, with an explicit awareness by the
author of the difficulties inherent in this concept.  Sahajanand
wrote:

<p>	A peasant is known as a grihastha, a person who earns his
livelihood by cultivation and agriculture, be he a petty
landlord, ryot or the labourer working for wages for
ploughing fields.  The Kisan Sabha does not desire that by
creating a separate organisation of agricultural
labourers, any strife should be let loose between them and
the ryots, nor should the latter oppress agricultural
labourers [<a href="#h94">Hauser 1994</a>, <a href="#h95">1995</a>]


<p>	A clarification was added to assure that `a grihastha should
not be called a landlord.  Only a handful of princes, big feudal
chiefs and wealthy individuals are landlords'.


<p>	The struggles of the Kisan Sabha taught it otherwise and made
its leaders rely more and more on agricultural labourers and the
poorer peasants.  By 1941, Sahajanabad [<a href="#s-g">-g]</a> was writing that the
agrarian problem could not be solved without solving the problems of
agricultural labourers.  He stated:

<p>	The Kisan Sabha belongs to those exploited and suffering
masses whose lot is connected with cultivation and live by
it.  The more they are oppressed and distressed the nearer
they are to the Kisan Sabha and the nearer it is to them.


<p>	Sahajanand [<a href="#s-g">g:59-60</a>] argued that through the process of de-
peasantisation, the poor peasants and agricultural labourers come so
close that `no demarcation line can be drawn.  Hence, it is proper to
regard agricultural labourers as kisans' so that the kisans and
agricultural labourers may struggle together.

<p>	In spite of the best of intentions, however, this did not
happen, so that in a few years, Sahajanand [<a href="#s44">1944</a>] admitted that the
Kisan Sabha was unable to get all peasants together and that `recall
the middle and big cultivators (were)... for the most part with the
Kisan Sabha.'  With characteristic bluntness, he stated:

<p>	They (middle and big cultivators) are using the Kisan Sabha for
their benefit and gain, while we are using or rather trying to use
them to strengthen the Sabha, till the lowest strata of the peasantry
are awakened to their real economic and political interests and needs
and have become claws conscious...  It is they, the semi-proletariat
or the agricultural labourers who have very little land or no land at
all, and the petty cultivators, who anyhow squeeze a most meager
living out of the land they cultivate and eke out their existence,
who are the kisans of our thinking... and who make and must
constitute the Kisan Sabha ultimately.

<p>	This, however, did not happen in Sahajanand's life time.  Nor
was he able to convince his associates full on this.  Even Rahul
Sankrityayana [<a href="#sa57">1957</a>:70-73], a founder-member of the Communist Party
in Bihar, wrote prevaricatingly in the 1940s:

<p>	There is no doubt that ultimately the rights of the
peasants and agricultural labourers are two sides of the
same problem.  It is also undeniable that the conditions
of agricultural labourers are piteous and their problems
must be solved.  However, we should remember that all
revolutions cannot be made at the same time...  Even if
agricultural labourers remain labourers, their wages will
go up only if the income of the Kisans increases... I feel
that it will be a serious mistake on their part if they
enter into a quarrel with the Kisans just now. 


<p>	Thus although the Kisan Sabha kept debating this question
without taking decisive steps to involve agricultural labourers in
the organisation, the agricultural labourers slowly started getting
organised in two ways.  The first was `bogus' organisations
[<a href="#s47">Sahajanand, 1947</a>] set up the zamindars and their agents who tried to
take advantage of the differences between the kisans and agricultural
labourers.  Several paper organisations, `patronised and financed by
the zamindars for duping the agricultural labourers and taking
advantage of their numbers to win elections' were set up
[<a href="#sa57">Sankrityayana, 1957</a>:72].  The second was a move on the part of some
leaders of the scheduled castes like Jagjivan Ram to set up a Bihar
Provincial Khet Mazdoor Sabha in 1937 [<a href="#h61">Hauser, 1961</a>:20n]; [<a href="#se48">The
Searchlight, 8 January 1948</a>].  Rahul exposed the first move by the
landlords through a series of blistering attacks (and when the second
was set up) he advised restraint on part of the ~harijan" leaders. 
He suggested that instead of taking up issues of agricultural
labourers as a whole these leaders should set up caste organisations
to carry out social reforms among them and to take up constructive
educational programmes.  To the agricultural labourers he promised
`pie in the sky':

<p>	Their problems will be solved after the advent of
communism and the revolution which has started today will
definitely go on to communism, not stopping at merely
abolition of zamindari but going on to abolish private
property in land.  Till then, the agricultural labourers
should aim at furthering the cause of the coming
revolution [<a href="#sa57">Sankrityayana, 1957</a>:70-73].


<p>	When it was first set up, however, the Kisan Sabha, far from
take up issues of abolition of the right of private property in land,
was not even concerned with the abolition of zamindari.  At first,
all its leaders including Sahajanand, merely wanted that the
zamindars should give `more concessions to the kisans'.  It was with
great difficulty and after serious debate that the Sabha   adopted
the demand of zamindari abolition [<a href="#s-3">Sahajanand, -e</a>;  
<a name="s52">1952</a></a>:442-443].

<p>	It was only after the great earthquake in 1934 that, when the
younger Congress elements were released from jail, they formed the
Congress Socialist Party.  Many members of that party (some of who
had earlier opposed the very formation of the Kisan Sabha) decided to
work with Swami Sahajanand in the Kisan Sabha.  These radical
elements quickly pressed for the adoption of zamindari abolition as
a policy of the Sabha.  Sahajanand was moving in that direction, but
was not yet prepared to accept to drastic a step.  Socialist Kisan
Sabha members introduced an abolition resolution at the first meeting
of the Kisan Council after they became members, and with an
eight-member group in a council of 15 got the resolution passed. 
Sahajanand resigned but was persuaded to continue and the resolution
was withdrawn at the intervention of a leading Socialist member. 
Another reason why the resolution was withdrawn was because there was
no agreement about the question of compensation.  Many Socialists
who, at that stage, were close to Purushotham Das Tandon (whom they
had got elected president of the BPKS in 1934) were in favour of
compensation being paid after the abolition of zamindari.  Sahajanand
and a few others insisted that if zamindari abolition was demanded,
there was no question of agreeing to payment of compensation.  In any
case, the resolution could not be passed in 1934 [<a href="#b35">BSCRO:16/1935</a>].

<p>	Through 1935, the Socialists kept introducing resolutions in
village and district-level meetings demanding zamindari abolition
when a suitable opportunity arose'.  Gradually, Sahajanand also came
round to the view that the zamindari system was `an obstacle in the
way of economic and social advancement of society' and that
`zamindars were parasitical elements fattening on the blood of the
toiling peasantry'.  Thus at the 3rd session of BPKS at Hajipur in
Muzaffarpur district, the policy of zamindari abolition without
compensation was adopted in November 1935.  This shift from
compromise to class struggle had been achieved and a new ideological
framework had been built for the peasant struggle in Bihar.  The
Council of Action of the Bihar Socialist Party described these
developments in the following terms:

<p>	The peasant leaders were provided the organic connection
between the social and economic structure and the poverty
of the masses.  They could (now)... see that the problem
had its roots in the social structure based on
exploitation of one class by another...  They could
(now)... see that the peasant problem was a part of the
wider problem affecting and embracing the whole society in
all its aspects and could not be solved in isolation [<a href="#se41">The
Searchlight, 3 April 1941</a>].


<p>	In spite of these glowing tributes paid by the Socialists to
themselves, Sahajanand remained the most radical peasant leader in
Bihar.  When, after Independence, the Socialists were getting lost in
the morass of ideological pretensions and incompetent actions through
the setting up of such splittist organisations as  the Hind Kisan
Panchayat [<a href="#se49">The Searchlight, 13 March 1949</a>], Sahajanand, just before
his death, pointed the direction of the future peasant movement by
forming an All-India United Kisan Sabha (AIUKS) whose fundamental
demand was `the nationalisation of land and waterways and all sources
of energy and wealth ... such nationalisation must also result in a
planned system embracing not only agriculture and the land but also
industries and social services'.  As its immediate demand,
Sahajanand's AIUKS [<a name="ai49">1949]</a> stood for `acquisition of land... from
those who possess vast domains (and) distributing them on reasonable
basis among landless labourers or holders of very small plots'.  In
the 1970s, the leading ex-Socialist of Bihar, Jayaprakash Narayan,
when defending the landowners in Musahari from the onslaught of the
labourers through futile Sarvodaya attempts [<a href="#js76">JSES, 1976</a>] would have
done well to remember Sahajanand's experiences and recall his
prophetic statement made in 1949 that `the rural proletariat ... is
becoming aware of its rights, duties and responsibilities...  When it
becomes fully aware, there will be the final dance of destruction and
then the present iniquitous agrarian system will start crumbling'
[<a href="#s-h">Sahajanand, -h</a>].

<p>	Today, when agricultural labourers, most harijans and adivasis,
have started agitating for their rights in different parts of Bihar,
the peasant movement of the 1930s seems finally to have reached its
culmination.  For many former peasant leaders, representatives of the
then `substantial tenantry' and today's rich peasantry, the chickens
hatched then have now come home to roost.


<p><strong><a name="proc">The Process</a></strong>

<p>	My presentation, while sketching the historic course of
the struggle only in its bare outlines, attempted to
explain the origin of the Peasant War, the position of the
various parties that played a part in it, the political
and religious theories by which those parties sought to
clarify their positions in their own minds, and finally
the result of the struggle itself as a necessary upshot of
historically established conditions of the social life of
these classes; that is to say, it attempted to demonstrate
the political structure of... the time, the revolts
against it and the contemporary political and religious
theories not as causes but as results of the stage of
development of agriculture,... (and) the commerce in
commodities... then obtaining.  This (is) the only
materialist conception of history. [<a href="#en69">Engels, 1969</a>]


<p>	For many years, in spite of having the above statement on
historiography in front of it, scholarship on the peasant question
got embedded on the shoals of mystification and demystification of
concepts and categories.  The increasing sophistication of academics
did not take into account that, in the final resort, learning is not
"a question of dialectical reconciliation of concepts" but "of the
understanding of the real relations" whose conceptual format would
give help in the commitment to define dimensions of oppression of men
by men and of the ways to struggle against them.  Thus, in the
quagmire of `scientificism' (which, for instance, considered Marx's
Capital more `scientific' than his Eighteenth Brumaire), the
peasantry, as a living organic entity, was forgotten in the interest
of studying capitalist transformation.  In any case, capitalism was
taken to mean `de- peasantisation', industry would, according to this
approach, inevitably outstrip, subordinate, and finally destroy
peasant agriculture.  So what was the need to waste time over the
genus "potato" in the "sack of potatoes"?  Hence, in the hands of
"the brilliant theorist and indifferent politician Plekhanov" the
peasants conceptually disappeared: "Peasantry is not a class but a
notion".  Other scholars, who did not go so far, concerned themselves
with studying ways in which capital penetrates agri,culture and
finally conquers it through a conflict of disem,bodied, inhuman
`forces'.  Yet others, nearer to the ground, were absorbed in the
economic phenomena: the study `production rela,tions', `market
relations' and the gradual disappearance of the peasantry through the
process of `differentiation'.  The logic of commodity relations, and
exploitative capacity of the richer peasants, indicated a necessary
polarisation of the peasants into rich and poor, and eventually into
`rural' capitalists and `rural' proletarians.  And, as for
production, it would inexora,bly move through the stages of serfdom
-- peasant farming -- agriculture and, finally, agri-business.  The
Marxists indulging in the Indian `Mode of Production' debate followed
the process of  differentiation as a law of nature and received nods
of approval from neo-classical economists.  Once in while, political
activists like Lenin and Mao Tse-tung have suddenly conjured up the
differentiating, disappearing peasantry as a major political force:
in their hands, peasants seemed to be transformed from derivations
and deductions to armies and actors.  But every time the dust settled
down, the scholars got back once again to work out the dates for the
disintegration of the peasantry in the face of the onward march of
industry, capital and the nation-state.Only, disintegration was not
necessarily inevitable.  

<p>	Without doubt capitalism transformed agriculture and
differentiation played an important part in the capitalist
transformation, which often represented very significant structural
changes.  The theoretical and factual claims in support of this are
valid.  It is the interpretation of it as the axiomatically necessary
and exclusive pattern, which is not.  The model should lead to an
increasing capital accumulation at the top.  Such a process would
de-peasantise, create a reserve army of labour, procure jobs for many
of the newly pauperised, turning them into proletarians and extending
capitalism in the classical sense.  

<p>	This did not happen.  The agrarian surplus accumulated neither
in the village nor in the towns nor even in the country, but in a
metroplolis thousands of miles away.  What followed was a
polarisation indeed, but a twisted one in which the downward trend
was not matched by an upward one, i.e. what occurred was not
differentiation and proletrainaisation of the majority, but a process
of pauperisa,tion expressed in the phenomena of the "surplus
population", "rural underemployment" and "culture of poverty".  It
was not a "reserve army of labour" which was produced, for there is
nobody to call on those reserves.  

<p>	The peasants did not dissolve and differentiate into capitalist
entrepreneurs and wage labourers, not were they simply pauperised. 
They persisted, while gradually transforming and linking into the
encapsulating capitalist econo,my, which pierces through their lives. 
Peasants continued to exist, though in the economy as a whole, many
of them were margi,nalised, being both within capitalism and outside
it.  They serve capitalists development (or lumpen bourgeois
development of underdevelopment), though in an indirect manner, a
type of perma,nent "primitive accumulation", offering cheap labour,
cheap food, cheaply captured markets for profit-making goods.  "They
produce also healthy and stupid soldiers, policemen, servants, cooks
and prostitutes; the system can always do with more of each of these. 
And, of course, they, i.e. peasants, produce tasks and troubles to
those scholars and officials who puzzle over `the problem of their
non-disappearance'.  The scholars have been proved working in their
optimistic, classical view of capitalism.  They had seen it as
aggressive, constructive, overwhelming and supra-energetic in its
capacity to spread.  Like the finger of Midas which turned everything
it touched into gold, so also capitalism was expected to turn
everything it touched into capitalism.  This did not happen."  	
The capacity of capitalism to milk everything and everybody
around it is undoubted; it is capitalism's capacity or need (in terms
of optimisation of profits and accumulation of surplus) to transform
everything around it into the likes of itself, which is not.  The
peasants are a case in point.  The alchemy of capitalism did turn
them from baser metals into higher ones but at best they became
merely 44 carat and not the genuine 22 carat gold. But most  scholars
missed this process.  They missed it not because their scholarship
was wrong or not "scientific" or "rigorous" enough, but because while
they were busy searching for the "peasantry as a theoretical economic
category", real flesh and bones peasants were living their day-to-day
existence, encounter,ing flesh and bones landlords, merchants,
money-lenders and, last but not the least, functionaries of the
State; and in this actual -- historical confrontation, they were, if
not stopping, at least diverting the onwards march of capitalism, and
upsetting the neat applecarts of industrialisation and modernisation
theories and prescriptions. 	

<p>	In our study of the peasantry in Bihar we have tried to deal
with just such flesh and bones beings and their actual, live,
experiences.  

<p>	While the advent of the Raj of the capitalist, colonialist
British, brought trade, some industry and even created a middle class
in the towns, it plunged Bihar into continuing backward,ness.  For
long BIhar suffered from the exploitation and oppres,sion which went
along with the Raj and its Permanent Settlement with intermediaries
who supplied the Raj with considerable reve,nue.  Bihar got very
little of the mitigating benefits which were available to the nodal
points of contact with imperialism.  For instance, even the
cultivation of cash crops -- opium and indigo -- did not have any
healthy aspects of growth, being cancerous developments fostered and
cut off according to the interests of external agencies.  At the same
time, the Permanent Settlement created a class of parasitic landlords
who, by and large, were interested neither in the improvement of
agriculture nor the contemporary cultural awakening.  Thus, Bihar had
neither the development of patni-holding, jotedar-type of prosperous
raiyats as a general feature, nor anything equivalent even to the
`renaissance' in Bengal as a movement.  

<p>	However, without any plan or even conscious effort, as
sporadic, spontaneous features, some of the peasants of Bihar slowly
started adopting new methods of agriculture and cultivating new crops
like potato, jute, sugar,cane and wheat.  Money came into the village
with these crops.  There gradually developed a class of `substantial
tenants'.  The prosperity of the latter was increased by markets for
the goods they produced, in the towns which emerged around British
administrative outposts and around the creation by the Raj, for its
own reason of countering zamindari turbulence, of irrigation schemes
like the Sone, and later the Tribeni Canal systems.  As the
prosperity of the `substantial tenants' increased, so did their
hostility towards the zamindars who were skimming off a large share
of the agricultural surplus.  In areas where the rate of evolution of
agriculture was a little faster, where cash-crop cultivation
became somewhat widespread, which were linked with the urban
consumers, landlord-capitalists, junkers, developed on the one side
and peasant-capitalists, kulaks, developed on the other.  It was in
these areas, like Patna, Gaya, Shahabad, Monghyr and Champaran, that
landlords unleashed particularly severe oppression to stall the
process of change.Simultaneously, resistance developed among the
tenants.  First they tried processes of social reform amongst
themselves, through caste associations.  But soon they were in
confrontation with the zamindars.  The latter were standing in their
way of dealing with the increasing pauperisation, immiserisation and
marginalisation by extorting rent in addition to the revenue which
the State demanded.  Thus, right from the beginning the movement had
com,bined anti-government, anti-landlord character.  The movement
articulated itself through the Kisan Sabha.  However, the Sabha,
though powerful and fairly widespread, was spontaneous, efferves,cent
and largely outside the control of political parties.  The Congress,
Socialists, Communists, etc. repeatedly tried to fit the movement
into their respective ideological straight-jackets; but in vain.  The
movement remained what it was -- an expression of the urge of the
relatively better-off tenantry to find ways of avoiding depredations
by zamindars, and of the poor peasantry to prevent its own
obliteration.

<p>	In this whole process, the State was not a silent spectator. 
In its first phase of establishing British rule, the government was
merely interested in the security of its revenue.  Later, the need of
expanding a market for its produce as well as avenues of investment,
made it enact greater security for substantial tenan,try.  Still
later, successive peasant movements brought State power face to face
not only with evidence of zamindari oppression but also with the fact
that a substantial portion of the agricultural surplus which could be
used as capital was being frittered away in conspicuous consumption. 
The emergent Indian capitalists, <em>Birla et hoc genus omne</em>,
particularly resented this and their organs -- political and media --
increasingly turned against the institution of zamindari.  At the
same time, the State was promoting agricultural growth and in this it
was as,sisted by the organisations of the substantial tenantry which,
at times, even gave up agitation against landlordism and took up
campaigns like `Grow More Food'.  

<p>	The zamindari system could not withstand the assault from three
sides, the substantial tenants, the Indian capitalists and the State. 
After the dissolution of the British Raj in 1947, the Permanent
Settlement was soon unset,tled.The substantial tenants and the Indian
capitalists had won their battle for accumulation and investment. 
And the State through it had succeeded in maintaining law and order. 


<p>	But what of the poor peasantry which was getting increasingly
pauperised without getting proletarinised?  Soon it was on its feet
striving for a process of "re-peasantisation".  It wanted land and
started agitating for it.  The challenge posed by the poor peasants
was sought to be met through ameliorative action, like Bhoodan on the 
one side, and promoting faster agricultural development on the other. 
The idea was to do away with conflict, promote harmony and at the
same time expand the restricted home market which was proving to be
a bottle-neck in the economy.  In this attempt, the State tried the
"trickle down" approach, developing the already better-off in down. 
The approach was called "betting on the strong" and seemed logical
enough, given the presumption of a harmonious countryside after the
abolition of zamindari.  But the presumption was wrong.  The gamble
failed.  And the Green Revolution started slowly staining itself red
at the edges.  

<p>	The depeasantised poor peasantry not only wanted land, but the
pauperised landless labourers wanted higher wages and dignity --izzat.  
The strategy of countering the upsurge this time was
repression.Thus, agrarian unrest in Bihar in the twentieth century
has had two rounds: the first at its height in the 1930s and 1940s
and the second beginning from the 1969s and 1970s.  Both rounds have
actually consisted of two fights each.  The first one was of (1) the
capitalists and middle class (utilising the peasant cannon- fodder)
against British imperialism and (2) of the substantial tenants
against the zamindars.  The second round too has two fights within
it.  While on the one side the poor peasantry is struggling for
survival against the rich peasants, landlords and the State, on the
other, the emergent kulaks, not finding further source of
accumulation and avenues of investment in agriculture, are turning
their energies to getting hold of the eternally milking cow -- the
government.  This is the content of the current `Backward Caste'
phenomenon in Bihar.


<img align=right src="../img/dast.jpg"></a>

<p><strong><a name="yest">Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow</a></strong>

<p>	So much has been written on the appalling agrarian conditions
in Eastern India, particularly Bihar, for people at large to
recognise that something is rotten in that benighted region. With
economists writing on the consequences of semi-feudalism,
sociologists bemoaning the brutalisation of society, political
analyst predicating the erosion of political morality, social ecology
developing a new and appropriate discipline of disaster studies and
even journalists ad nauseum reporting horror stories, it has been
clear that the situation is nearing the breaking point. Something had
to give and something new had to come out. And so it has.

<p>	In response to the near-total break-down not only of the
democratic polity but also of established norms of law and order,
reflected in Bihar in the phenomena of booth-capture, mafia
maraudings and macabre harijan hunting, all springing from the
tension between an antiquated agrarian base and a lumpenised cultural
and political superstructure, the subaltern people in the region have
always struggled to create space for themselves to survive in
dignity, if not in peace. Much of the struggle has been unassuming,
unspectacular, even mundane. Occasionally it has burst out into great
upheavals such as those led by Birsa Munda or Sahajanand Saraswati.
The present episode of this continuing struggle is qualitatively
different from the earlier ones in as much as it combines both the
elements of long drawn day-to-day resistance to oppression at the
village level and spontaneous combustion of the overall polity
exemplified in the creation of a new democratic consciousness.
Demonstrations in Patna intervening in the process of changing  the
grand structure of the prevailing politics, have as their point of
departure the flaming fields where the fire now has spread far and
wide.

<p>	Before going into details of the situation, it is necessary to
note that the emergent counter-force in Bihar is no flash in the pan.
As early as May 1982, the Bihar Government in its "Notes on Extremist
Activities- affected Areas" reported that as many as 47 out of a
total of 587 blocks, spread over 14 districts, were affected by the
`Communist extremist' movement. In a research paper in Economics and
Political Weekly, Professor Pradhan H. Prasad reproduces a table from
the government's "Notes" which showed that 10.28 per cent of the
village, 8.23 of the population, 7.24 of the area, 9.46 of the net
sown area and 11.98 of the gross sown area had been affected by
"Communist extremist" movement as early as May 1982. Subsequently, if
anything, the movement has grown in the face of the corrupt, casteist
and incompetent administration of Bihar.

<p>	Let us examine the nature of this `Communist extremism'. What
has it actually done which would put it outside the pale of
`mainstream' politics? The most common charge against `Communist
extremists' is that they reject the possibility of peaceful solutions
to socio-economic problems and resort to violence. The charge carries
some credibility on account of the experience of the first phase of
the Naxalite movement which was characterised by at times mindless
violence. But the situation in Bihar today is very different.

<p>	In a state where violence has become the generalised mode of
social intercourse, where even according to government figures more
murders are committed every day than in Punjab, where, as Arun Sinha
has pointed out, "The major feature of social as well as political
life is the prevelanec of the language of force, arms in particular"
where "landlords of every village are armed to the teeth and control
some private gang of lumpens or other" where "the focal point of
armed violence is the institution of landlordism which, on account of
its dispersed existence, presents a brilliant demonstration of the
Gandhian mode of decentralisation of power", the approach of the `new
Naxalites' towards social violence is indeed a marked contrast to
prevalent mores.

<p>	The prime organisation representing the 'new Naxalites', the
CPI (ML) Liberation  group, states unequivocally, "First of all, we
do not subscribe to any theory of `excitative violence' and still
less to `individual assassination'". On the issue of violence, its
position is conditioned by the prevailing situation: 

<p>	"Everywhere in Bihar, it is the landlords who are armed,
they derive a sadistic pleasure by beating and killing
poor peasants, burning their houses and raping their
women. Secondly, by any human logic whatsoever, the rural
poor cannot be denied their right to organise their own
resistance forces to counter the attacks of landlord
armies. Thirdly, if peasant struggle takes violent forms
in Bihar, the root must be sought in the forms of
oppression."


<p>	In fact, reports from Bihar indicate that wherever these 'new
Naxalites' have managed to acquire significant strength the incidence
of day-to-day rural violence has gone down considerably. It is they
rather than the established police machinery that are the best
guarantee of law and order in the complete sense of the term.

<p>	Another feature attributed to 'extremists' is their lack of
participation in the processes of electoral democracy. Again, this
was true of the first phase of the movement which was characterised
by infantile adventurism. Emerging out of a long and sustained
struggle among peasants in the Gangetic plains of Bihar, the 'new
Naxalites' appreciate the potency of the electoral processes, though
they are not blinded by the stars of parliamentary practices in their
eyes. It is clear to them, as to any observer of the electoral scene
in Bihar, that a massive charade has been going on in the name of
elections in the state. The practice of "booth capturing" has been
institutionalised in many areas and in effect this has meant that
large numbers of voters, in particular scheduled castes, tribes,
landless labourers and women have been disenfranchised.

<p>	Thus, the first task of deepening and extending social
democracy in Bihar comprises not of aiming for electoral victory but
merely to provide for participation of the people in the
actualisation of universal adult suffrage. The unobstrusive but
significant engagement of the `new Naxalites' in Bihar with electoral
democracy found expression in their participation in the 1985
assembly elections under the banner of the mass organisation known as
the Indian People's Front. Although their candidates did not win, the
signal achievement was that in every constituency that they contested
booth capturing was prevented and democratic norms, tomtomed by
others but seldom put into practice, were actualised by those who are
mst criticised for lack of faith in elections. In this context, the
organisation noted, 

<p>	"Defying severe police repression and attacks by the
landlords' armed gangs, the peasants cast their first ever
vote in their life. While all the champions of
parliamentary democracy - Congress, Lok Dal and CPI like
- were busy capturing booths, the fighting peasants of
Bihar, through their conduct in the elections, proved that
they are the real representatives of democracy." The
recent setting up by the IPF of 'Matdata Suraksha Samitis'
(Voters' Protection Committees) in view of the forthcoming
elections is part of the process of actualising democracy
at the grassroots.


<p>	Given this kind of non-dogmatic approach and their record of
not only ensuring economic gains for the rural poor through enforcing
payment of minimum wages, prescribed by law but seldom actually paid
by landowners, and even distribution of some ceiling-surplus lands in
accordance with long-enacted but hardly ever implemented legislation,
but also taking up `constructive activities' like upgradation of
community assets in the shape of irrigation works, wells pastures
etc., the 'new Naxalites' in south-central Bihar have been playing a
role comprising both regulatory and promotional aspects. In short,
their struggle has come to represent the very process of state
formation in an otherwise anarchic situation.

<p>	The qualitatively new aspect of the `new Naxalite' movement as
an important force in left politics has not had its significance
properly noted by outside abalysts. Political commentators on Bihar
have got bogged down in the morass of the Congress-Janata syndrome
and even as sociologists try to untangle the various strands of its
complicated caste web, they have, by and large, ignored the broad
correspondence of the caste and class structure. A refreshing aspect
of the 'new Naxalite' movement has been that, unlike vulgar Marxists,
it has neither ignored the caste question nor has it gone overboard
on non-class understanding of caste, culture and ethnicity. Its
creative encounter with caste in Bihar is evidenced by the appeal to
kurmi and yadava peasants as well as to dalit labourers, but the same
time it recognises that caste is not an invariant absolute. The
non-dogmatic and non-sectarian approach is also reflected in
discussion of other extra-economic matters like the position of
women, issues of cultural heterogeneity etc.

<p>	The new politics of the left in Bihar has been spreading not
only in the areas of original Naxalite activity like Bhojpur but also
to the tribal Jharkhand region and eastern U.P. Organisationally,
there is a variety of bodies involved in the movement. They range
from various factions of the CPI (ML), the most prominent being the
Liberation and Party Unity groups, guerilla groups, like the MCC,
mass organisations like the IPF and Mazdoor Kisan Sangram Samiti and
agrarian trade unions like the Kisan Sabha. Although many of these
groups have distinct organisational forms and there is even some
rivalry between them on carving out `spheres of influence' there is
similarity in their intent if not in their modes of operation.

<p>	In spite of the existence of several such organisations,
fratricidal conflict which was a marked feature of the earlier
Naxalites is much less today. There are occasions when these
organisations criticize each other even severely, as for instance in
the Liberation group's denunciation of the tactics of the MCC in
utilising caste conflict which led to the Dalelchak-Baghaura and
other massacres, but there have been instance of cooperation between
these groups and indeed between them and other democratic elements
even in parties like the Samajwadi Party and CPI. The re- enactment
of Jallianwalla Bag ar Arwal in April 1986 saw a broad movement
arising with the participation of all who were horrified by the
extent and nature of police atrocities. Today, the unfolding of the
fodder scam has once again provided the opportunity for the Left and
democratic groups to unite.

<p>	Indeed a significant aspect of the `new left' in Bihar has been
that it has rejuvenated the tired old CPI which continues to have
mass support in different areas of the state. The CPI had built its
base from the 1930s when it had effectively led the anti-zamindari
agitation. In the process it developed some fairly impregnable
citadels like the Begusarai belt in central Bihar where a village is
known to till today as the `Stalingrad of Bihar'. After its dalliance
with the different United Front Governments in the 1960s and on
account of its national policies which were clearly out of tune with
the politics of Bihar during the `J.P. period', the CPI started
losing its cutting edge on agrarian issues even while retaining some
degree of mass support. The emergence of the radical and militant
agrarian movement in recent years outside the CPI has put pressure on
its cadre to reactivate and again start intervening in the
anti-feudal and broadly democratic movement.

<p>	Similarly, the trade union movement in Bihar which, faced with
the depredations of the mafia in the coalfields and elsewhere, had
got somewhat bogged down in narrow economism and even opportunism 
has been affected by the new trends. Although on the industrial front
the situation remains grim, the fact that popular and honest leaders
like A.K. Roy are again active against the mafia murders is not an
unrelated development. The involvement of the `New Left' with
re-emergent Jharkhand movement in terms of highlighting the genuine
grievances of the tribals is also not insignificant

<p>	At the same time, the role of organisations like the Jan
Sanskriti Manch, All India Student Association, Revolutionary Youth
Organisation, Inquilabi Minorities Manch, Janwadi Mahila Morcha etc.
in the struggle against religious fundamentalism, obscurantist
ideology, rank casteism and feudal oppression of women, in short in
a democratic awakening in semi-feudal Bihar is increasing. And
perhaps as logical outcome of the increasing presence of this `New
Left' in Bihar is its intervention in macro-issues.

<p>	In the 1970s, the Naxalite movement in Bihar weeakend on
account of three major factors: its own adventurist stupidity, the
developmentalist and cooptational intervention of Jaya Prakash Narain
and repression by the state. But the movement did not collapse.
Indeed, the grim agrarian situation and overall deterioration of the
political scenario of the state created a new and more vital left.
Its challenge cannot be met by old prescriptions. It embodies the
emergence of a specific social democracy in the peculiar situation of
Bihar.

<p>	It is difficult to delineate the formal organisations which are
involved in the peasant upsurge and related political, social and
cultural movements that are taking place in central Bihar. At most a
general picture of the organisational networks can be drawn with only
an approximation of the different complexities that hold the network
together.

<p>	In fact, the conglomeration of organisations can trace its
beginnings to the organised peasant movement in the area began in
1928 with the formation of the Patna District Kisan Sabha under the
leadership of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati. Later it developed into the
Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha and became the core of the All India
Kisan Sabha which struggled against zamindari. After zamindari
abolition in the 1950s, although the formal organisation remained
extent, largely under the control of the Communist Party of India
(CPI), it lost its teeth. In the 1970s when the peasant movement grew
up again in the region, albeit on different premises and demands,
several rudimentary mass organisations of peasants came up here and
there. In the early 1980s, the need was felt to consolidate them into
one formation and the Bihar Pradesh Kisan Sabha was launched once
again. It claimed continuity with the original Kisan Sabha of
Sahajanand, even as it took up new issues related primarily to the
demands of the small peasants and agricultural labourers.

<p>	The peasant militancy in the region proceeded from the late
1960s under the direction of and impetus provided by the Communist
Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI-ML). Lack of proper
ideological orientation, internal dissension and repression by the
state and local vested interests brought about the effective collapse
of this once formidable organisation so that by the mid-1970s, it had
for all practical purposes fragmented beyond recognition. The largest
surviving faction was known as the CPI (ML) - Liberation group, so
called on account of its party organ, Liberation.  Over a period of
time, this group reorganised and has today grown into a formidable
force. Another faction which had a small presence in the area in the
1970s but which has grown subsequently goes by the name of the
Central Organising Committee of the CPI (ML) - Party Unity. These two
have minor ideological differences with each other but retain their
separate identities. They also have separate mass organisations.

<p>	Many of these organisations combined in the 1980s into a large
umbrella organisation known as the Indian Peoples' Front (IPF). It is
difficult to today to delineate the various elements of the IPF from
each other or from the whole and in any case, when the CPI(ML) itself
emerged from the underground a few years ago, the IPF virtually
became defunct. Hence in the account which follows, often the names
of difficult formal organisations like the BPKS. CPI (ML) and IPF
have been used interchangeably. 

<p>	The movement in central Bihar covers several districts: among
them,  Bhojpur, Rohtas, Patna, Gaya, Jehanabad, Aurangabad and
Nalanda. In north Bihar, it is growing in Siwan and other areas. The
CPI(ML)- Liberation is the main leading force behind it.  This phase
of peasant struggles in Bihar had its genesis in the heroic struggles
of Bhojpur and Patna between 1972 and 1979.

<p>	The present phase of peasant struggle began in the rural areas
of Patna in early '80s and soon spread to Nalanda and Jehanabad.  A
new awakening took place in Bhojpur, Aurangabad, Rohtas and parts of
Gaya.  The government replied with massive police actions. Assisting
the armed gangs of landlords, better known as private armies,
undertaking certain administrative and economic reforms, mobilising
the support of different political parties, particularly the CPI and
Sarvodaya groups, as well as of the news media -- the government made
multi-pronged attempts to suppress the movement. The organisation
records

<p>	In the face of these governmental measures and duel to our
own tactical mistakes, we suffered setbacks and losses in
certain areas and had to make retreats and readjustments
in many other areas of operation.  On the whole, however,
we successfully countered these measures and succeeded in
disintegrating the private armies, restricting our losses
to a minimum and retaining the initiative in our hands.


<p>	In essence, the entire struggle revolves around three
issues:

<p>	(i) For an increase in the wages of agrarian labourers,
who account for 30-40% of the rural population in these
areas....

<p>	(ii) For the seizure of surplus, vested and homestead land
in occupation of landlords, mahants, and rich peasants;
and distribution of the same among landless and poor
peasants....

<p>	(iii) For the social dignity of dalits and backward
castes.  As it strikes at the root of feudal authority,
this struggle tends to become quite intense and the entire
range of upper castes of babusahebs, babhans and babajis
becomes the target.  On the other hand, such struggles,
draw support from almost all the classes of backward
castes.  There are always some exceptions though, from
both the sides.  Generally, in all the villages a small
section of progressive people from upper castes cooperate
with this struggle, while sections of backward castes join
hands with reactionaries from upper castes.  Under the
impact of struggle over all these years, certain sections
of upper castes in several areas have begun to change
their traditional attitudes.

<p>	To effect a greater polarisation among people on class
lines and to unite broad sections of rural population, we
are trying to take up many other related issues as well,
say, recording of tenancy rights, mobilising people
against the corruption of block officials, etc.  The
question of corruption is linked with agrarian
development, as the lion's share of benefits is usurped by
these officials in collusion with local reactionaries. 
Besides, action against dacoit gangs, certain village
development works, relief measures etc. are also taken up
to unite the broad masses of rural population.

<p>	We hold that only an integrated programme of struggles and
activities on all such issues can ensure broad peasant
unity under the leadership of agrarian labourers and poor
peasants.  

<p>	We are often accused by opportunists of all hues of
disrupting the broad peasant unity and of pitting agrarian
labourers against peasants.  By sacrificing the interests
of agrarian labourers and poor peasants and by refusing to
mobilise them in mass struggles, their class consciousness
and class solidarity cannot be developed, nor can their
leadership be established over the peasant movement. 
Naturally, the so-called broad peasant unity simply boils
down to unity under the leadership of rich peasants. 
There is no middle way.

<p>	We still cannot claim to have altered the class and caste
balance in our favour, but gradually we are heading
towards building this unity on a new basis.  In certain
areas, middle peasants and middle sections of upper castes
are also being mobilised under the banner of Kisan Sabha.


<p><strong><a name="whod">Whodunit</a></strong>

<p>	Remains the task of identifying the dramatis personnae.  Just
as the acts and scenes themselves have not followed a tight sequence,
the cast of characters has also changed.  The initial lead was taken
by `outsiders', in particular Sahajanand who stood outside the
dproduction process as a sanyasi and as such may fall in lthe
category of the lumpen intellectual.  The othe rimportant characters
too, like Gandhi, Jaya Prakash Narayan, Rahul Sankrityayana, K.B.
Sahay, etc. though having more interest in land and its ownersship
than Sahajananad, were also essentially `outsiders' in their
character.  They were not directly affected by the process of the
agrarian economy.  Their action was not a result of experience but of
consciousness acquired extraneously.  Their process of action, in
fact, followed the course of 

<p>	Consciousness -- Action -- Experience.  

<p>These `outsider' leaders did no directly go to the peasants but
operated through local level leaders like Jadunandan Sharma,
Ramnandan Mishra, Raj Kumar Shukla and others who reached
consciousness of cdeprivation through actual experience, and wanted
action to remedy the situation.  For them the process was 	Experience -- Consciousness - Action.  

<p>Finally, there were (and are) the peasants themselves who, having
neither sophisticated theory nor wide experience, acquire both
experience and consciousness through action in the process: 

<p>	Action -- Experience -- Consciousness. 

<p>The interaction of these three types of elements also was not
confined to one stage.  In the first stage, in the period before the
Second World War, initiative was with the outsiders and they
intervened through local leaders and reached the peasants gener,ating
the development of consciousness. In the period of the Second World
War, Quit India Movement and the advent of Independence, the
`outsiders' were either busy with high political affairs, in jail or
in government.  Hence the initiative came in the hands of the local
leaders who launched struggles through which a great deal of
experience which was useful later was gained:in this process,
zamindari was abolished and many local leaders benefited either
personally or as members of a class of substantial tenants.  The
acquired vested interests in the changed situation and slided to a
back-seat in the context of agrarian movements.  For several years,
there were indeed no significant movements.  With time, however, in
the 1960s, a new set of ideologically-oriented `outsiders' emerged
and reached the country,side to join the peasant masses in their
struggles.  However, by then, in many areas like Champaran, Purnea,
Bhojpur, and Dhanbad, the peasants themselves had grasped the
initiative.  Hence followed a process of action:it is this action
which is taking place in many parts of Bihar today.  The action is
sporadic and spontaneous.  And it is faced with brutal repression by
the landlords, rich peasants and the State.  In many instances it
takes the form of caste, rather than class, conflict.  In some cases
the former allies and even leaders of the poor peasantry have become
its oppressors and it is not uncommon that yesterday's substantial
tenants are today killing poor peasants, burning their miserable huts
and raping their women. On the face of it, the situation of the poor
peasants, agricultural labourers and other toiling people in Bihar is
desperate; it seems it will never change.  But propelled by the very
desperation of the struggling, toiling people, Bihar is changing. 
`And yet it moves.'



<p><strong><a name="frie">..... And Friends</a></strong>

<p>	Swami Sahajanand Saraswati passed away a few years after
Independence and before the legislation abolishing zamindari could be
enacted. However, he had led a strong enough movement to make that
phase of "land reforms from above" inevitable. 

<p>	However, as the agrarian change process got bogged down in
legalisms on the one side and resistance by vested interests on the
other, the focus of politics changed. Class issues were relegated to
the background as wheeling and dealing for the loaves and fishes of
office took precedence.

<p>	Scholarship in social sciences has a habit of following
political trends. Thus, it was not surprising that in the years
following Independence, the attention of most academics engaged in
contemporary studies was focused on the goings-on in "mainstream"
political parties, in particular the Congress. It required academic
imagination in that context to research peasants, peasant
organisations and their leaders. Walter Hauser was among the first to
do so. When the smouldering embers of peasant activism appeared to be
smouldered under the ashes of realpolitik, it did require some moral
as well as intellectual courage to look at peasant activists as
subjects -- rather than objects -- of research. Mind you, this was
before the period when environmental studies or gender studies became
"valuable" because not only were they politically corect but also
academically pragmatic. Besides, this was also the period when,
before the <em>Journal of Peasant Studies</em> and other such publications
lifted the peasant from the footnote to the text of history.

<p>	Swami Sahajanand was re-discovered by Walter Hauser also well
before <em>Subaltern Studies</em> turned history into mere literature and
social science into mere literary criticism. His tools were
imperfect, perhaps; being conventionally accepted and tried and
tested. He did not, and perhaps could not too, indulge in looking at
the various meanings of discourse and the sub-text of records. And
yet, somehow, anyhow the moral imperative mattered. Just as it did in
the case of the saffron-robed "red Swamy". 

<p>	It could not have been easy for Walter Hauser to carry out his
research when he did. Those were still the years of the "Ugly
American", when <em>Time</em> magazine was denouncing Jawaharlal Nehru as a
dangerous crypto-communist and Non-Alignment was seen as a vile plot
against the "Free World". In India too, not only had the strength of
the Kisan Sabha ebbed after the Telengana Uprising but probing into
its past -- particularly by an American -- must have seemed
distinctly odd. The fact that the publication of Hauser's thesis was
delayed only added to the mystery.


<p>	And yet, Walter Hauser did not let the past of the Kisan Sabha
become mere history. Not only did he make copies of his thesis
available to libraries like that at the A. N. Sinha Institute of
Social Studies in Patna but he kept on both researching the discourse
of Sahajanand as well as the Phoenix-like quality of the Kisan Sabha
which rose from its own ashes in the 1970s. Of course, in the latter
case, it was the fact that the peasants of Bihar who reinvigorated a
comatose organisation added to the effort of the scholar.

<p>	Swami Sahajanand Saraswati has still not got his due from
history. Despite the efforts of Walter Hauser and others who have
studied the life and times of that absolutely fascinating
personality, Sahajanand has been largely forgotten and when he is
remembered, it is as a leader of the Bhumihars. Recently, peasant
assertiveness has made some dent in this image-creation and
historical misappropriation but in a time when the agrarian conflict
paradigm has shifted from the tenant-zamindar tussle to the
labourer/poor peasant-junker/kulak antagonism, when the Ranbir Sena
of the Bhumihars is aggressively ranged against today's Kisan Sabha,
it is necessary perhaps to review the evolution of Sahajanand. Walter
Hauser is doing that. More stregth to his elbows.

<p><strong><a name="ackn">Acknowledgement</a></strong>

<p>A more detailed account of peasant movements in Bihar is contained in
my book,  <em>Agrarian Unrest and Socio- Economic Change in Bihar</em>.  I am
grateful to all those who helped me in many ways in completing that
study.  It is not possible here to name all of them, but in
particular I wish to record my debt to Laksmi Mandal and Jahoor Ali,
poor peasants in Bihar, who not only aroused my interest in the
subject but also bore with me in many ways, and to Professor B.B.
Chaudhury and Dr Walter Hauser, from whose pioneering works I have
drawn heavily.  I also specially thank Vinay Kumar Sharma who
cheerfully typed the present work, square brackets and all.


<p>Much of the description of the Kisan Sabha is taken from the
unpublished work of Dr Walter Hauser who had the opportunity to look
at organisational documents of the Kisan Sabha in the 1960s before
many of them disappeared from Bihta.  The reference to Hauser's work
cited here may not match the original pagination as it is taken from
a typescript prepared from Dr Hauser's thesis, a copy of which he has
kindly made available to the A.N.S. Institute of Social Studies,
Patna.
