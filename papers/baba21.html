       When Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from his long sojourn in South
Africa he was a man with a revolutionary idea but no political vehicle
through which he could put it into practice. The idea, of course, was
Satyagraha, the application of the concept of ahimsa, whose conceptual
roots lay in the Bhagavad Gita and the Vaishnav sect in which he was
reared, to political action. The logical setting for promulgating his
doctrine was the Indian National Congress, the only major party-structured
political organization in India which was under the control of native
leaders. However, the Indian National Congress, while having come into
existence in 1885, had thus far failed to evolve an ideology and
organizational structure pervasive enough to generate a truly mass-based
political movement of the proportions that would be required to cut across
the vast congeries of cultures, nationalities, castes, classes, and
religions into which India was subdivided. While not exerting a negligible
influence on British policies towards and behavior in India, Congress had
remained essentially an instrumentality of the country's urban and
professional classes preoccupied with passing resolutions demanding
political reforms and at times (as in the Bengal Partition in 1905)
generating public protest of sufficient magnitude to unnerve the Raj, even
to the extent of provoking it to resort to political repression (as with
the Rowlatt Act in 1919 which led directly to the Jalienwala Bagh
massacre). Jawaharlal Nehru had characterized the pre-Gandhian Indian
National Congress as a "debating society"!<p>

       Once he achieved a dominant position in the Indian National
Congress, Mahatma Gandhi successfully transformed it into a mass-based
organization able to translate his ideology into political action on the
grand scale. The main reason he was able to make this transition was
Gandhi's imaginative invention and manipulation of symbols that resonated
in the minds and hearts of Indians from all walks of life. Especially
important in this regard was the ability of Gandhi's charisma and symbolic
creativity to draw the country's peasantry into the political arena and
persuade them that their increasingly vocal demands for social and economic
justice would be fostered by the political party in whose name the Mahatma
spoke. Gandhi accomplished this daunting task by adopting the persona of a
political sadhu, an image that effectively resonated with so-called
sadharan janta (ordinary folk) in the countryside whose social
consciousness was steeped in the morality and mythology of rustic
Hinduism.<p>

       This was a fundamentally important linkage not merely because it was
the way political discourse had always been expressed in the dehat. It was
also fundamentally important at this juncture in Indian political history
-- viz. in the 1920s -- because, in UP and Bihar, at least, a widespread
pattern of agrarian unrest had been underway since the end of World War I
which was drawing on the same reservoir of traditional idioms and symbols
for political expression that Mahatma Gandhi was employing in his efforts
to "radicalize" the Indian National Congress. There was, in other words, a
fortuitous convergence of political articulation occurring among peasants
and non-cooperators which in this formative stage of the transition of the
Freedom Struggle from the parlor to the streets made it seem that the two
might be made for each other. The kisans were a budding insurrection
groping for higher order organizational sophistication and enhanced
political legimacy. The non-cooperators -- i.e., the Indian National
Congress -- were a heretofore rather benign political organization groping
for a new identity that would enable them to up the political ante in India
by acquiring a genuinely mass following. Each seemed poised to try and
coopt the other.<p>

     As a prelude to our analysis of this pivotal aspect of Indian
political development at the start of the inter-war years, it is
interesting to see how this developing convergence was being perceived by
those who were on the spot. A letter written by J. C. Faunthorpe, the
Commissioner of Lucknow District, to the Chief Secretary of UP on January
14, 1921, illustrates official perceptions of what was taking place.
"Having only returned to this country [presumably from home leave]," he
declares, "I am not well informed on the history of the non-cooperation
movement, but I have formed the opinion that the non-cooperators, finding
their efforts to stir up trouble among students and the general public
unsuccessful, had to look round for some more promising field for their
operations... They have succeeded in stirring up the cultivators of Oudh to
a state of considerable excitement because the cultivators have in many
cases considerable grievances against the landlords. <a name="bk01"></a>
(<a href="#fn01">Footnote 1</a>}<p>

       Although accurately depicting the magnitude of agrarian unrest in
Awadh at this time, Commissioner Faunthorpe had a simplistic conception of
cause and effect. Nehru understood the situation better. While he also saw
that non-cooperation was "reaching the remotest village," he also realized
that Congress was by no means the instigator of agrarian unrest. While
Swaraj "was an all-embracing word to cover everything," he wrote,
nevertheless, "the two movements -- non-cooperation and the agrarian --
were quite separate, though they overlapped and influenced each other
greatly in our province."  <a name="bk02"></a>(<a href="#fn02">Footnote 2</a>)<p>

       At the grass-roots interface between these two streams of political
ferment there was by no means either an identity of ideological intent, or
clarity as to who was co-opting whom. For the Awadh peasantry and their
Bihar counterparts political dissent had taken on nativistic overtones, a
sort of class warfare pursued in the name of Raja Ram instead of Karl Marx
against the economic rapacity of taluqdars and Bhumihars. For the
non-cooperators, political dissent excluded class conflict as a matter of
principle because, according to Gandhi, it allegedly 'divided' Indians who
must be politically one if they ever were to succeed in overcoming white
man's rule. The latter were willing to place their imprimatur on the
political struggles of a dowtrodden peasantry only as long as the peasantry
abandoned, in the name of ahimsa, the central purpose of their bitter
struggle -- the destruction of the landlord classes who were responsible
for their plight. Yet initially, despite the differences, the two were able
to cross-fertilize each other.<p>

       Since 1919, the Awadh countryside had fallen into political turmoil
mainly as a result of what can only be termed a veritable breakdown in the
traditional social order.  In the post-war period, population was rapidly
increasing and land values were consequently rising. To take advantage of
this inflationary situation, the land-monopolizing taluqdari class were
searching for ways to increase their rents and cesses, and the pressures
they put on their tenantry in pursuit of this end threatened even further
the already shaky hold which the cultivating peasantry enjoyed on the land
they tilled.  Simultaneously, market conditions were causing the cost of
the coarser food grains consumed by the tenantry and the landless laborers
to increase more rapidly than the refined food grains consumed by the
elite. <a name="bk03"></a>(<a href="#fn03">Footnote 3</a>)  
Such economic distress at a time when in
so many ways the country was experiencing rapid and disruptive social
change in effect shattered what trust the peasantry retained in the pattern
of feudal relations that had contributed to a modicum of stability in the
countryside (such as the pattern of religiously sanctified jajmani
relationships) and provoked a grass-roots political upheaval. As Siddiqi
puts it, "By 1920... the development of social tension in Oudh had taken
the form of an economic conlfict between the different interests of the
agrarian classes."  <a name="bk04"></a>(<a href="#fn04">Footnote 4</a>)  In other
words, class warfare had broken out!<p>

       The Awadh kisan movement threw up a leadership whose imagery and
modus operandi had, as already suggested, drawn upon precedents for
political expression contained in the rich folk mythologies of rustic
Hinduism. Its leaders presented themselves to the rural masses as "Babas"
or what may be termed "political sadhus."  They legitimized their political
messages by infusing them with a religious content and presenting the
messengers in the saffron garb of holy men. In this, they anticipated
contemporary ethnoreligious parties like the BJP and the Shiv Sena by more
than half a century!<p>

       Babas sprang up throughout the Lucknow, Faizabad and Gorakhpur
divisions of Awadh. <a name="bk05"></a>
(<a href="#fn05">footnote 5</a>)  They rallied the large gatherings of peasants 
who flocked to their standard with cries of "Ram Chandra ki jai" and "Sita-Ram 
ki jai" and with readings from Tulsi Das's Ramayana. Employing the traditional
panchayat as their structural model, they organized so-called kisan sabhas
whose purpose was to articulate peasant grievances with the landlords and
press for reforms in the agrarian system. The most famous of these early
political babas was a man named Sridhar Balwant Jodhpurkur who was born in
Neemuch district of Bombay Presidency, became a "wanderer" (avarra) at age
thirteen, found his way to Fiji at eighteen where he changed his name to
Ram Chandra Rao in order to disguise his Maharashtrian Brahman origins
(because they were politically suspect). He returned to India in 1904 to
avoid prosecution for his agitational activities among the indentured
workers in Fiji, became a sadhu in Ayodhya in 1909, settled at Pratapgarh
in 1919, and, in the words of the police records of the day, "almost
immediately started spreading disaffection among the peasantry." By the
time he reached Awadh, Ram Chandra had a political agenda and a wealth of
experience for carrying it out. Significantly, Jodhpurkur married a woman
of the Kurmi caste (one of the major middle castes of this region) and
commenced calling himself "Baba Ram Chandra." Moving around the region with
a copy of the Ramayana under his arm, he blended readings from this popular
Hindu epic, which combined allegorical denunciations of both the Raj and
the landlords, with appeals to the peasantry to act in concert against
their exploiters. A legend in his own time, Baba Ram Chandra became the
model par excellence of the indigenous peasant politician. He was a major
force in broadening the the political impact of the first formal Kisan
Sabha that had been established in 1917 by Jhingury Singh and Sahdev Singh
at an underproprietary village in Gorakhpur district named Rure.  V. N.
Mehta, the Deputy Commissioner of Pratapgarh district, and a native
official with strong sympathies for the plight of the peasantry, includes
in his famous Report of November 11, 1920, an excellent depiction of the
elemental conceptualization which went into the formation of this
prototypical peasant body at Rure village. Inaccurately attributing its
founding to Baba Ram Chandra, he states:

<blockquote>    The people of Rur[e] were suffering from no disabilities nor had
they any grievances. The cause of the selection of Rur[e] as the
headquarters of the Sabha is rather interesting. When Rama and Laxmana
attended Sita's Swayamvara, Tulsidas described them as follows: "In the
assembly of the Rajas the two brothers shown like two moons in the galaxy
of stars. [Raj Samaj Virajat Rure]"</blockquote>     

"Rur[e]" means beautiful. "Rure" was constructued to mean "in Rur
village." <a name="bk06"></a>(<a href="#fn06">footnote 6</a>) <p>

      The non-cooperation movement initially catalyzed the peasant
movement not because the Gandhiized Congress was in ideological agreement
with either its aims or its tactics, which they emphatically were not, but
simply because in the peasantry's eyes Gandhi was Congress. To the sadharan
janta, in a rustic Mcluhanesque sense, Gandhi himself, not his message, was
the message. He was seen as the penultimate political saint, a grand-scale
holy man whose darshan, purported supernatural powers, and promise of
swaraj was what really mattered.  He was a larger than life manifestation
of the political sadhus who were driving the kisan movement. His ubiquitous
presence in every corner of society infused their struggle against the
landlords with a milennarian energy and conferred upon it an overarching
legitimacy. Shahid Amin, in his masterly study of Mahatma Gandhi's impact
in Gorakhpur district in 1921, clearly shows this. Thus:

<blockquote>         ... what people thought of the Mahatma were projections of the
existing patterns of people's beliefs about the the 'worship of the
worthies' in rural north India. As William Crooke has observed, the
deification of such 'worthies' was based among other things, on the purity
of the life they led and on 'approved thaumaturgic powers'. The first of
these conditions Gandhi amply satisfied by all those signs of saintliness
which a god-fearing rural populace was prone to recognize in his appearance
as well as his public conduct. As for thaumaturgy, the stories [which]
attribute to him magical and miraculous powers which, in the eyes of
villagers nurtured on the lore of Salim Chishti and Sheikh Burhan, put him
on a par with other mortals on whom peasant imagination had conferred
godliness." <a name="bk07"></a>(<a href="#fn07">footnote 7)</a>  </blockquote><p>

       There are two senses in which the Gandhi-factor was important to the
kisan sabha movment. The revitalistic atmosphere he generated enabled the
numerous babas who sprang up throughout the countryside to wrap themselves
in the symbolic mantle of both baba and non-cooperator. "The 'power of a
name' was evident again in Awadh in the first years of the 19020s,"
declares Gyan Pandey, as "Both 'Baba Ram Chandra' and 'Gandhi' came to
acquire an extraordinary appeal." Ram Chandra appeared to develop a
"multiple personality," says Pandey: he was reported to be in Bahraich 
on the 5th [January 1921] by Nelson, to be in Bara Banki at the same 
time by Grant, and in Fyzabad by Peters.<a name="bk08"></a>
(<a href="#fn08">footnote 8</a>)<p>


       The other sense in which the Gandhi factor was important is that it
drew Congress field workers toward the kisan movement despite the
misgivings of Gandhi and other high ranking, urbanized party magnates about
its class warfare proclivities. Baba Ram Chandra led a delegation of 500
followers from Gorakhpur to Allahabad in early June of 1920 (allegedy to
coincide with a holy bath at Prayag on a Saptami day) in an effort to
broaden the movement by putting it in touch with "Mahatma Gandhi and other
educated urban leaders."  They were unable to meet Gandhi and Nehru
disparaged Baba Ram Chandra's 'lack of a program.'  However, in Sharma's
words, "For three days the marchers propagated their woeful tales in the
city." And most important, I think, "They came in touch with the U.P. Kisan
Sabha people who arranged for their stay." Despite this, however, "The
urban leadership was... somewhat reluctant to take up the cause of the
Pratapgarh peasants." But in the end it was agreed that P. D. Tandon, Gauri
Shankar Mishra, K. K. Malaviya and Nehru would visit their villages.
<a name="bk09"></a>(<a href="#fn09">footnote 9</a>) <p>

       This was a breakthrough that helped pave the way for the mutual
cooptation that would eventually lead to the incorporation of the agrarian
question (i.e., a class agenda) into Congress's inventory of designated
ideological tasks. It catalyzed interplay between the Babas in the kisan
sabha cells and the local level operatives in Congress who were in contact
with the peasantry under the rubric of the Oudh Kisan Sabha, Congress's
answer to the spontaneous kisan sabhas whose appetitite for class conflict
the middle-class Congress leadership so heartily deplored and eagerly
desired to coopt and reorient towards Gandhi's more benign version of
non-cooperation'. These local level persons were not easily
distinguishable in their demeanor, dress, and educational level from their
non-Congress counterparts. In Faizbad District, there were two highly
active Congress political sadhus, Kedar Nath Arya and Deonarain Mishra who
exemplified this blurred line between the two at the grass-roots level.
After one of Deo Narain's agitational escapades, the Commissioner of
Faizabad Division, was prompted to declare to his boss, Sir Harcourt
Butler: "Deo Narain is a person of at best unbalanced mind if not actually
tinged with insanity." <a name="bk10"></a>(<a href="#fn10">footnote 10)</a><p>

       The process of Congress's absorption of the kisan movement was not a
linear one. At the very time that interplay between it and Congress
grass-roots field workers was increasing, the leadership of both underwent
growing disenchantment with one another. This was mainly the fault of the
Gandhi-dominated Congress which refused to side with the kisans against the
taluqdars in the name of ahimsa. This opened the way for the Raj to step in
and forcefully crush the peasant movement. In Gyan Pandey's words:

<blockquote>         By the winter of 1921-2, the peasant movement in Awadh had
overcome many, though by no means all, of its own traditionalist
limitations. Yet, its localism and isolation remained. To get over these it
needed an ally among other anti-imperialist forces in the country. But the
chief candidate for this role, the party of the growing urban and rural
petty bourgeoisie, had turned it back on the peasant movement long before
that time.<a name="bk11"></a>(<a href="#fn11">footnote 11</a>)</blockquote><p>

<p>       The final fusion of non-cooperation with peasant revolution required
another decade before both sides were ready for each other. It came in the
form of the creation of the Congress Socialist Party in 1934. This was the
point when a younger generation of Congressmen, among the most noteworthy
of whom were Jawaharlal Nehru and Acharya Narendra Dev, imbued with a
mixture of Marxist and Fabian socialism, was able to persuade a significant
segment of the Congress to address the agrarian question.  They were
especially successful in UP where class conflict in the countryside had
been particularly acute, where many of the sub-movement's young leaders
came from, and where many had cut their agitational teeth under the
tutelege of some of the more noteworthy political sadhus who had built
followings among the peasantry in their home districts. Acharya Narendra
Deva is a perfect case of this maturational process. An asthmatic son of a
rich, Arya Samajist merchant in Faizabad city, the son had been radicalized
while a law student at Banaras Hindu University, had returned to the
district and became a follower of Lallanji, a founder of the Congress
peasant strategy in Faizabad (through his association and identification
with Deonarain, Kedar Nath and other rustic revolutionaries), and in turn
became one the founders and principal intellectuals of the Congress
Socialist movement by the 1930s.<p>

       Time does not permit further elaboration of this consummating stage
in the process of conjuncture between non-cooperation and rustic class
warfare in the east gangetic dehat. That must await the conclusion of this
research. But we can conclude with the observation that Congress neither
created the agrarian movement in this region nor failed to influence its
nature and outcome. There was an interplay between two separate streams of
revolutionary activity. At the outset, neither was culturally prepared to
fully understand and appreciate the other's situation and problems.
Congress was too urbane and hung up on the politics of Independence to cope
with class issues. The kisans were too unsophisticated and preoccupied with
bread and butter issues to see the value in deferring immediate social
justice for a larger and largely abstract political good.
