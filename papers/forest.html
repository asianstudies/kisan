<blockquote>The villagers do not divulge each other's secrets. 
They steal timber from the river bank at night and send it to 
their relatives and  friends living at a distance from the river.  
And when stolen  timber is found in the possession of any one 
of them they  can easily obtain false receipts from petty retailers of
timber which they produce in courts in their defence.

Scholars have increasingly realized that older notions of 
resistance do not explain the  
complexity of social and economic relations within 
society.
<A NAME="R003"></A>
<A HREF="#N003"><SUP>3</SUP></a> In the context of environmental  
history, resistance to the state until recently, was 
read off the contrast drawn between
pre-colonial subsistence and colonial commercial 
economy.

<A HREF="#N004"><SUP>4</SUP></a>
 Much of the recent literature on forest history <p>
 

<b>++ Page 2 Grover</b><p> 
 
has treated local communities with sensitivity 
and has highlighted the complexity of relations within
and among these communities.
<A NAME="R005"></A>
<A HREF="#N005"><SUP>5</SUP></a> I suggest that 
we need to go further beyond the notion of 
resistance while examining local opposition to 
state policies. There were several ways that local 
communities responded which included, but were 
not limited to, unorganized protest or open 
confrontation with the state. Resistance implies a 
defensive and a reactionary stance. Moreover,  
the agency of the community (or peasant) also 
gets confined within state parameters of law and crime.
I suggest the idea of a shadow economy, one in 
which peasants not only resorted to subversion, but
created a distinct culture that nestled within, and in 
some ways overlapped that of  
the state. One cannot really conceive of two 
entirely separate economies--one anchored in the state,
and the other ensconced in the local society.

The commoditization of timber in the middle of the 
nineteenth century in Himalayan  Punjab was accompanied 
by forest policies by which the colonial state 
delineated distinct forest  spaces for timber regeneration. 
The state imbued forests with its own notions of space, power,  
and authority--expressly stated through boundaries, laws, 
property, and rights. The local <p>
 
<b>++ Page 3 Grover</b><p>
 
communities contested these legible state 
spaces not only for livelihood--for subsistence needs 
were taken care of through forest settlements, 
however inept their distribution--but also for the   
benefits that accrued from the commoditization 
of timber. The creation of informal timber   
markets in which the reach of the state 
was limited clearly points to the suggestion of a 
shadow economy. <p>

The region I examine to make my argument is 
broadly the trans-Dhauladhar region of the 
Ravi, Beas and Sutlej divisions, which forms 
part of today's Himachal Pradesh.
<A NAME="R007"></A>
<A HREF="#N007"><SUP>7</SUP></a> I begin with
the premise that the pre-colonial society had its 
own circuit of commercial exchange--hats 
exemplified a vibrant economy. Trading contacts 
between the hills and the plains had existed since 
ancient times, and had even influenced state 
formation in various micro-regions.
<A NAME="R008"></A>
<A HREF="#N008"><SUP>8</SUP></a> Forest products 
such as gum lac, turpentine, and Indian incense (jalap) 
formed an integral circuit of commodity exchange.

It was not the presence or the absence of  
 money, of markets, or of cash transactions that 
differentiated a pre-colonial from a colonial
forest economy, but the manner in which these 
different economies came to operate. <p>
 
As forests and pastures formed an important 
component of the village economy's resource  
base, boundaries between villages evolved to 
demarcate their access. These boundaries were not  
permanent but altered with changing contingencies 
of the period. In general, the village society  
in Himalayan Punjab was not isolated, 
topographically marked, or bounded by 
maps, but fluid with adaptable social 
complexes that harvested trees, collected 
forest products, grazed livestock, and lopped 
trees. It used timber for domestic and 
agricultural purposes (cut branches, 
collected leaves and fallen wood for 
fodder and fuel,
<A NAME="R011"></A>
<A HREF="#N011">
<SUP>11</SUP></a>   and harvested honey), 
grazed its livestock in wasteland
<A NAME="R012"></A>
<A HREF="#N012">
<SUP>12</SUP></a>  for manure, 
meat, and wool, and used local herbs and 
flowers for fodder and general use.
<A NAME="R013"></A>
<A HREF="#N013">
<SUP>13</SUP></a>  Local 
artisans made ropes from bagar grass, brushwood, 
and the bark of small elm trees. 
They earned revenue by selling fruits (walnut, 
apricot, and peach), medicinal roots (<b><i>karu</i></b>, 
<i><b>patis</i></b>),<p>
 
<b>++ Page 5 Grover</b><p>

and incense (<b><i>bethar, gugal, dhup</i></b>) in the market.
<A NAME="R014"></A>
<A HREF="#N014">
<SUP>14</SUP></a>   
They also sold honey and ghi (clarified
butter). <p>
 
 Forests had been the private reserves of local 
rajas in the pre-colonial days, but had not been really
tapped as a revenue-generating resource. Rather 
they were retreats for royalty, and tracts for hunting
(shikar). They also provided natural political 
boundaries for local states, which meant that forests were
sometimes clear-cut to remove havens for 
enemies during periods of war.
<A NAME="R015"></A>
<A HREF="#N015">
<SUP>15</SUP></a>   Access to forest
(and other) products was, even before the advent 
of an economically restricting colonialism, already
quite restricted. The local rajas controlled 
distributive rights to land and forests, the highest form was
the hereditary right of cultivation called warisi. 
The raja conferred the right by a pasta (deed of grant),
which was never granted for a whole village or 
even a hamlet, but to individuals. It was always for
specific fields or cultivable plots of which not 
only the rent, but also the name and area were specified
in the deed. When an assignee or an intermediary 
claimant was strong enough, he could break up land
and settle cultivators, but the rajas seldom ousted 
a cultivator so long as the latter paid his dues.
<A NAME="R016"></A>
<A HREF="#N016">
<SUP>16</SUP></a>  
Local rajas derived most of their revenue from 
agricultural and pasture-lands, and a much smaller
amount from tolls and custom taxes. However, 
owing to transport logistics, limited demand, and
modest state requirements, the use of timber did 
not attain the proportions it did as under the
British. <p>
 
It is clear that this pre-colonial society cannot be 
characterized as ecologically pristine, <p>
 
<b>++ Page 6 Grover</b><p>

maintaining idyllic harmony with nature. There were 
several restrictions within which it operated. In
general, the raja recognized the importance of forests, 
and maintained the strictest system of forest
conservancy. The zamindars did not have free access 
to forest regions; green trees could not be felled
without permission. In most principalities, the 
raja imposed a thak. a prohibition of grazing in certain
forest regions for three months during the 
monsoon.
<A NAME="R017"></A>
<A HREF="#N017">
<SUP>17</SUP></a>  
The extent to which forest produce was
appropriated remained limited to the 
consumption needs of society. In the absence 
of a large commercial demand, the sale of timber 
was limited. The relative contrast between production for sale
and for local use was precisely that--a relative 
and not an absolute contrast. In other words, the
accumulation of wealth through the marketing 
of forest products had not yet become a common form
of economic activity for the hill society.

<font size="+1"><b>Forests and the Colonial State</b></font><p>

Once the British annexed Punjab in 1849, 
forests came to be tapped on a much larger scale for
their commercial use--railways, barracks 
and cantonment towns were state enterprises that needed vast
amounts of timber. The novelty of timber use 
lay in the subsequent introduction of forest laws, the
codification of forest rights, a further restriction 
of access to forests, and the subjection of local
communities to greater taxation, fines, and 
imprisonment. The colonial state-represented 
by the forest department--defined forest space as 
distinctly separate from cultivated land, and imbued the former
with a homogeneous character. Forest space was 
meant for timber <p>
 
<b>++ Page 7 Grover</b><p>

regeneration, and not for grazing, or 
shifting agriculture. Furthermore the state also separated
the trees from the land on which they grew, thus 
fracturing space into distinct units. What grew on 
land became significantly relevant to its 
legal identity.
<A NAME="R019"></A>
<A HREF="#N019">
<SUP>19</SUP></a>  
In other words, forest boundaries 
became the norm in the new idiom of 
the colonial domain, in which access to forests was
deeded, incorporated, and indexed by law. <p>
 
 However, the colonial state was by no means 
the only claimant to forest resources. Local rajas,
<i><b>zamindars </i></b>(land-holding villagers), 
peasants, and grazers also used forests
extensively.  Indeed, forests connoted a different 
kind of wealth for the local economy, quite apart from timber.
Local communities were entitled to forest use, but 
the nature of these rights depended on the newly
constructed land-tenure system and the amount of 
land revenue paid to the state. No local community
was allowed to directly partake in the timber 
economy of the state. The state drew upon a complex
ideology of conservation to justify the 
exclusion of local communities from forest reserves.<p>
 
The Kangra region particularly highlights the 
varied strategies adopted by the state for purposes of
timber extraction and forestry.
<A NAME="R020"></A>
<A HREF="#N020">
<SUP>20</SUP></a>  
Suffice it is to 
state here that timber did not occupy the center-stage
in Kangra. In fact, the land revenue department 
prioritized cultivation over forestry in Kangra, and the
forest department had to continuously stake its claim over forests.
<A NAME="R021"></A>
<A HREF="#N021">
<SUP>21</SUP></a><p>
 
<b>++ Page 8 Grover</b><p>

The various land settlements by C.G. Barnes 
and J.B. Lyall resulted in the creation of new 
bounded village communities, grazing rights in 
common lands, and land revenue as the prime 
determinant for access to forests.
<A NAME="R022"></A>
<A HREF="#N022">
<SUP>22</SUP></a>  
Tenants 
and non-landholders were left out of this new 
distributive system.
<A NAME="R023"></A>
<A HREF="#N023">
<SUP>23</SUP></a>  
Since the state viewed 
most local rights in forests as incidental to their 
proprietorship in the soil, they stipulated 
various categories of right-holders. The first class of 
right-holders was the proprietary body of 
the villages that had complete rights in the common 
lands in proportion to the revenue they paid.
<A NAME="R024"></A>
<A HREF="#N024">
<SUP>24</SUP></a>   
The second class of right-holders were
purchasers of the right to wasteland from the 
first-class holders; they were not required to pay any revenue. 
Most of the recent settlers in Kangra, including 
the tea-settlers, came under this category. The 
third class of right-holders were revenue payers 
who had been accessing demarcated forests and 
wasteland for decades. In other words, their rights 
were not based <B>on the </B>ownership of
property, but that of use. The grazing 
community--Gaddis were one such right-holders. <p>
 
Many of these right-holders had to be persuaded 
to relinquish their rights over 'wasteland' <p>

Back <a href="#top">to the top</a><br>
<b>++ Page 9 Grover</b><p>

either in favor of tea plantations or government 
forest reserves.
<A NAME="R025"></A>
<A HREF="#N025">
<SUP>25</SUP></a>  
While the forest department's 
negotiations with zamindars centered around 
their own concerns of commercial value of timber. 
the <i><b>zamindar's </i></b>concerns 
extended beyond timber access to concerns of grazing and
land-use.  However, forest rights did not 
acquire any kind of fixity. As the demand for timber increased, 
the state further regulated its claims over 
trees, and reinterpreted earlier settlements. James 
Lyall's scathing note on Anderson's 
Report of 1897 is a classic case of how settlement reports 
were reinterpreted.
<A NAME="R026"></A>
<A HREF="#N026">
<SUP>26</SUP></a>  
Let me cite an 
example. While preparing the record-of-rights, Anderson 
had declared that all <i><b>khewatdar 
</i></b>(person entitled to a right by virtue of a sole or joint
property in  the subject of the right recorded 
in the deed) proprietors of waste and forest land had full
<i><b>bartan</i></b> (rights of use over 
land or trees in a protected forest which is or are the property of
another)  rights on trees on their land. 
Lyall insisted that their rights had to be limited. 
Furthermore,  Anderson had recorded that the 
management of the grazing of sheep and goats, and the right to 
realize dues from shepherds was entirely 
in the hands of the government. Lyall asserted that 
there was no foundation for this with regard 
to the sheep and goats kept by village proprietors. 
These &quot;pseudo rights,&quot; as Lyall 
referred to them, had to be backed by law.<p>
 
The subsequent forest settlements in the 
Kangra and Kulu region in 1894 and 1897 capped the
process of demarcating forests and 
delineating the rights of the people. Even in private
<i><b>zamindar</i></b> forest land, zamindars 
could not sell timber without official permission. If they <p>
 
<b>++ Page 10 Grover</b><p>

did, they forfeited the privilege of obtaining timber 
from demarcated forests at favorable rates. 
The British adopted this step to ensure that 
private forests continued to be maintained.<p>

<a name="peop"></a>
<font size="+1"><b>Forests and Peoples</b></font><p>

<blockquote>Now this question of rights in the forest is one not easy of 
adjustment, especially when it  assumes a political bearing 
from the fact that the greater portion of the people 
belong to those classes who inhabit the forests, and as it were, 
live in them.. It will be both possible and advisable, by 
gradually and judiciously asserting the claims of 
government, and avoiding any sudden enquiry into the 
question of prescriptive rights, to accustom the minds 
of the pople to our presence iin the forests, and to 
dispell their pre-conceived ideas of quiet and 
undesturbed rights to the bushwood and jungle.
<A NAME="R027"></A>
<A HREF="#N027">
<SUP>27</SUP></a></blockquote>

By 1874, two years after this report by Lieutenant-Colonel 
Pearson, forest rights in Punjab had undergone considerable 
change.  The forest department regulated local access to 
forest resources and prohibited forest harvesting for sale or 
monetary profit.  To ensure this, it recorded local user-rights 
based on <b><i>wajib-ul-arz</i></b> (local deeds), and atempted to codify 
what appeared to it as rather diverse congeries of localized 
customs.  Forests had to be preserved for conservancy reasons, 
for commercial extraction of timber, and for an economy of use.  
And for all these three purposes, local user-rights had to be 
identfied, and curtailed if necessary.<p>

The aim of the forest department was to locate the rights of 
the villagers in one forest area, while freeing the other class 
for commercial treatment; and, in the case of Kulu, almost 
the only possible comercial treatment in the export of 
<b><i>deodar</i></b>.
<A NAME="R028"></A>
<A HREF="#N028">
<SUP>28</SUP></a>  
For instance, the department listed<p>

<b>++ Page 11 Grover</b><p>

62 species of trees which they considered 
suitable for use in building, to be given for local
consumption only on payment.
<A NAME="R029"></A>
<A HREF="#N029">
<SUP>29</SUP></a>  
Not only did 
the zamindars have to take permission, but they also
had to pay a subsidized rate for the timber 
they received for building purposes. Earlier, there had been
no limit on the number of trees that could be 
felled for building purposes at zamindari rates. But in
Kangra tahsil, due to the presence of a 
sizeable European population that generated a huge demand for
trees, a limit was imposed on the number 
of trees a zamindar could fell for building or repairing his
house. For instance, a zamindar could not 
fell more than 25 trees, out of which no more than
10 could be of the chil species. Furthermore, a zamindar 
had to pay four <i><b>annas </i></b>per tree;
the market rate for certain species of timber 
illustrates the differential market values assessed for different
species by the colonial state: <p>
 
<b>Selling rates of trees for others than right-holders</b>:
<A NAME="R030"></A>
<A HREF="#N030">
<SUP>30</SUP></a> <p>

<table border=1 width=50%>
 
<tr><td><b>Deodar</b></td><td>Rs. 15.00</td>
<td><b>Walnut</b></td><td>Rs. 12.00</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Kail</b></td><td> Rs. 5.00 </td>
<td><b>Chil</b></td><td> Rs. 1.00 </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Tos</b></td><td> annas 8</td>
<td> <b>Elm</b></td><td> Rs. 2.00 </td></tr>

</table>
<p>
 
There was little or no timber export from Kangra 
tahsil, the forests being too far from the Beas river,
and the existing selling rate for a chil tree, 
namely Rs. 8/-, was prohibitive. But there was a large local
demand by <i><b>zamindars, </i></b>tea-planters, 
and other residents in the Kangra valley for
buildings, tea-boxes, firewood, and charcoal.
<A NAME="R031"></A>
<A HREF="#N031">
<SUP>31</SUP></a>   
Once the demand for tea picked up, chit became 
very important for the making of tea boxes, 
resulting in great pressure on the chil forests in the <p>

<b>++ Page 12 Grover</b><p>
 
lower Kangra region. The British finally 
prohibited its sale except for building purposes in
1873.  All tea planters were allowed to 
get rai and tos, especially suitable for tea boxes, at four annas
per tree. <p>
 
The issue of grazing occupied considerable 
ground in the debates over forestry. Some British officials
like Barnes and Lyall opined that grazing in 
itself did not interfere with the natural production of
forests. For instance, Lyall cited an example 
of a forest officer who was unsuccessfully attempting to
grow timber in fenced land in Kulu <B>from 
which </B><i><b>deodar </i></b>had recently been
cut, while deodar grew naturally in a nearby area 
where cattle came daily, without any damage.
<A NAME="R032"></A>
<A HREF="#N032">
<SUP>32</SUP></a>  But the
overwhelming view in the forest department was 
that grazing undermined forestry.
<A NAME="R033"></A>
<A HREF="#N033">
<SUP>33</SUP></a>   The setting of
fire to grasslands was specifically considered 
a bane of the forest department.
<A NAME="R034"></A>
<A HREF="#N034">
<SUP>34</SUP></a>   Subsequent
settlements by Lyall, and the Forest Act of 
1878 not only regulated <i><b>zamindari </i></b>rights
to grazing, but also effectively restored 
the state's authority to regulate pasture lands. Lyall's settlement
clearly stated that since rights of 
<i><b>bartandars </i></b>were appended to<p>

<b>++ Page 13 Grover</b><p>

cultivated land which was assessed, their 
grazing rights were also &quot;limited to the cattle of a
man's own household kept for his domestic 
purposes, [and] not for trade purposes, such as the sale of 
milk or ghi.&quot;
<A NAME="R035"></A>
<A HREF="#N035">
<SUP>35</SUP></a>   The same rules 
held true for khewatdars (owners of land). The zamindars
were now allowed to graze their cattle in the 
<i><b>ban kharetars </i></b>(unassessed grass reserves)
after the grass  had been cut, provided the soil 
of the <i><b>ban kharetars </i></b>was the 
common property of the village or  hamlet. <p>
 
Since small land holdings could not fulfill 
the needs of the local society, they necessitated a mixed
agricultural-pastoral economy. One of the 
ways in which local landholders ensured that their fields
were manured was by allowing grazing 
communities such as the <i><b>Gaddis</i></b> to stay on
their land for several days during the latter's 
migration to and from their alpine grasslands. It was a mutual
arrangement that proved beneficial to both 
parties.
<A NAME="R036"></A>
<A HREF="#N036">
<SUP>36</SUP></a>   For the landholders, it meant fertilized 
fields; for the <i><b>Gaddis,</i></b> it meant free 
rest periods, with food, grain, and sometimes money, during
their rather long journeys.
<A NAME="R037"></A>
<A HREF="#N037">
<SUP>37</SUP></a><p>
 
The <i><b>Gaddis</i></b> were already 
subjected to taxation in the pre-colonial period. They had
been frequenting the Kangra region prior to 
the advent of the British.
<A NAME="R038"></A>
<A HREF="#N038">
<SUP>38</SUP></a>   As they migrated for fodder <p>

<b>++ Page 14 Grover</b><p>

from the higher alpine regions of Chamba, Lahaul 
and Bashahr in the winters, to the relatively milder
climate of the Kangra region, the <i><b>Gaddis</i></b> 
traded in the meat, wool, and milk of
their livestock. Their rights were not appended 
to cultivated land at all, but were personal rights of
a hereditary nature, exercised on the basis of 
<b>tirni</b> (grazing tax) payment to the raja. The 
<i><b>Gaddis</i></b> had access to 
demarcated grazing runs in the region, 
each being grazed over by the
same <i><b>Gaddis</i></b> year after year, 
on payment of a small fee to the raja who collected it
through the mukadam (head Gaddi).
<A NAME="R039"></A>
<A HREF="#N039">
<SUP>39</SUP></a>   Most of 
the grazing runs were located between the kandi (main range)
and large grazing runs on the low hills towards 
the river Beas where the <i><b>Gaddis</i></b> 
usually spent several weeks en route 
to the Kangra plains.
<A NAME="R040"></A>
<A HREF="#N040">
<SUP>40</SUP></a><p>

With the introduction of the 1878 Forest Act 
and the subsequent forest settlements, especially
Anderson's revised settlement of 1890, 
the <i><b>Gaddis</i></b> now held the lease of
their runs directly from the government. Subsequently, 
detailed inventories of each shepherd's pasture
area, the size of flocks, the specific migration 
route and the time taken to move from one area to another
were made. Grazing runs were to be taxed,
<A NAME="R041"></A>
<A HREF="#N041">
<SUP>41</SUP></a>   
and the <i><b>Gaddis </i></b>were treated as asamis 
or tenants of the government, who paid their 
tax to the <i><b>muqaddam</i></b> (headman), quite
independent of <p>

<b>++ Page 15 Grover</b><p>
 
the village proprietors.
<A NAME="R042"></A>
<A HREF="#N042">
<SUP>42</SUP></a>   Although the <b><i>dhars</i></b> 
were personal and hereditary in nature, it often 
happened that the <i><b>muqaddam </i></b>brought 
in outsiders to graze in his runs (if he felt that
the <i><b>dhar </i></b>was 
being under-used, or if he got a higher revenue).

<A NAME="R045"></A>
<A HREF="#N045">
<SUP>45</SUP></a>   For instance, when 
the old Chamba forest lease of 1864 came up for 
renewal, provisions were made for excluding 
from certain tracts all grazing, and especially the 
vast flocks of sheep belonging to non-resident 
shepherds (<i><b>Gaddis)</i></b> who passed
through the land. <p>
 
The first quarter of the twentieth century 
witnessed a further regulation of the
<i><b>Gaddis</i></b>' pastoral movements. 
The British government had to deal with two new
determinants: competition for winter grazing 
lands, due to increasing local herds of livestock in the
Kangra region, in addition to a substantial 
rise in the local livestock for milk and meat. The British
were not really concerned with the 
movements of the Gaddis in the alpine 
regions. But they considered
the Gaddi migration to the Kangra 
region in the winter as a threat to land 
increasingly coming under pressure. By the 
beginning of the twentieth century, they had, 
once again, resorted to an increase in the
grazing tax. A Gaddi in Chamba had to pay 
Rs. 4-11-0 per 100 sheep and12-8-0 per 100 goats to the
Chamba state in November at the time of his 
departure from the area. <p>
 
<b>++ Page 16 Grover</b><p>
 
He then paid another tax of the same 
amount in February in Kangra. If he 
halted more than a day, he was subjected to 
a halting fee of Rs. 4-11-0 per hundred sheep 
and Rs. 12-8-0 per 100 goats. A Gaddi in the Kangra 
district had to pay comparable rates. 
Interestingly, this did not  produce any substantial 
decrease in the number of sheep kept by them. 
Clearly, the profits which the <i><b>Gaddis </i></b> 
realized from the sale of their livestock products 
more than covered these additional costs. <p>
 
 In 1915, the British differentiated goats and 
sheep in the levying of the autumn tax. One hundred goats
were henceforth charged Rs. 6/-, while 100 
sheep were charged Rs. 4/-A similar tax was formulated for
winter grazing grounds as well. In the following 
year, the British also levied a tax on sedentary goats
and sheep. Their aim was to reduce the total 
livestock migration into Kangra, and to pressure the
shepherds to raising only sheep. The Forest Department 
considered goats the worst enemies of forests;
they were held responsible for much of the denuded 
state of the Punjab plains.

The presence of forests in close proximity to 
settled agriculture resulted in a greater dislocation of
local-user rights in Kulu, once the British initiated 
the demarcation of its forests.  The average
assessment per acre in Kulu in the late nineteenth 
century was Rs. 2/-, which was comparable to that in
the Kangra tahsil, with its two crops a year, and 
proximity to markets with good roads (which fetched
higher prices for agricultural produce). On the 
other hand, the populace in Kulu had more
comprehensive forest rights: fuel, fodder, 
grazing and manure, without which they could not have
existed. In his Settlement Report, H. Diack 
emphasized that <p>

without free grazing, access to fallen leaves 
for mulch, free firewood, and free timber for building
purposes, a cultivator could not continue 
to pay the customary high rent.
<A NAME="R047"></A>
<A HREF="#N047">
<SUP>47</SUP></a>    In Kulu, no rights were
allowed in any first-class forest which 
contained <i><b>deodar.</i></b> In fact, the
Forest Department declared that its object was to 
convert all mixed forests as speedily as possible into <i><b>deodar
</i></b> forests, and one way of speeding the 
process was to encourage the removal of other timber by
villagers.
<A NAME="R048"></A>
<A HREF="#N048">
<SUP>48</SUP></a>   And as in the rest of the Kangra 
region, right-holders in forests were also made responsible
for forest fires. But what affected the Kulu 
zamindars  most was the official transformation of their whole
area into &quot;forest&quot; with the exception 
of their homesteads and cultivated area. In a note on
the Kulu Forests Settlement, the Lieutenant-Governor, D. 
 
Fitzpatrick, wrote: 
 
<blockquote>The moment a man steps out 
of the enclosure of his house or off his field he will be in a government
forest and subject to the forest law. He cannot 
take his plough bullocks to his field or to water without
taking them through &quot;forest.&quot;
<A NAME="R049"></A>
<A HREF="#N049">
<SUP>49</SUP></a></blockquote>
 
The <i><b>zamindars</i></b> in other regions 
such as the Chamba and Bashahr divisions were
also subjected to similar restrictions in the 
exercise of their rights. A code of forest 
rules was always appended to a lease.
For instance, zamindars were not allowed 
to cut down forests for purposes of cultivation, nor burn
jungle without the permission of the forest officer.  
They were not allowed even to carry any
implements for cutting wood without authorization or 
license.<A NAME="R050"></A>
<A HREF="#N050">

right-holders experienced such impersonal 
changes, one expression of which was that they were

but by the name of the hamlet to which they 
belonged.

It is clear from the table that the greatest 
reliance on forests was for fuel and fodder leaves. Many of the
forest products on which the local populace 
was dependent, remained the poor cousins of British
&quot;forest capital,&quot; and came to be 
classified as 'minor forest products.
<A NAME="R053"></A>
<A HREF="#N053">
<SUP>53</SUP></a>  But the state
still <p>

<b>++ Page 19 Grover</b><p>
 
had ensured that the local populace had access 
only through a legal and formal domain of rights. 
And rights, in the absence of a formal legal 
precedence, were conferred by the colonial state. 
Forest law, as it developed, was a colonial 
invention that eventually effaced local custom. <p>
 
<a name="fury"></a>
<font size="+1"><b>Local Muted Fury: 
Timber and beyond Timber </b></font><p>

And yet, life in and around forests continued, even 
as it was restricted by laws, and disrupted by
fines. Most reports on forest administration detail 
the forest rights enjoyed by rightholders in protected
forests. For instance, rightholders received 23 per 
cent of the total outturn of timber, 74 per cent of
firewood, and 77 per cent of minor produce.
<A NAME="R054"></A>
<A HREF="#N054">
<SUP>54</SUP></a>   By 
the 1890s,about 80 per cent of the forest area in the
Punjab hills was allowed for grazing, and in the 
Kangra District zamindars were allowed a share in the
timber earnings to win their support for forest policy.
<A NAME="R055"></A>
<A HREF="#N055">
<SUP>55</SUP></a>  
In view of this seeming largesse, the high rate
of petitions and forest offenses recorded in the 
very same reports seems incongruous. It is this seeming
incongruity that I examine in this section. The colonial 
connotation of timber was at variance with the
local populace. But, the availability and price of 
timber were the direct outcomes of colonial policies
that were determined by the market. As something 
fundamental, basic, and even prosaic for the
local <p>

<b>++ Page 20 Grover</b><p>
 
economy, what Mintz terms &quot;extensification,&quot;
<A NAME="R056"></A>
<A HREF="#N056">
<SUP>56</SUP></a>  
wood acquired a different connotation in
British nomenclature; disengaged, 
distinctive, and in some senses 
extraordinary. There was no clear 
way to reconcile these different 
world-views, and friction between 
the two was inevitable. Its 
outcome was an extensive shadow 
economy that included 'illegal' timber sales. <p>
 
It was not always a matter of the number 
of rights conferred by the British; the place, timing, and
manner in which they were accorded were 
of considerable significance as well. The zamindars in the
Kulu region were given rights to fell timber, but 
they had to walk several miles to collect that timber.
<A NAME="R057"></A>
<A HREF="#N057">
<SUP>57</SUP></a>  
They were also allowed to cultivate their land, 
but the moment they stepped outside their land, they
were in &quot;forest&quot; where even carrying 
an axe was considered to be a crime. They were
permitted to keep livestock, but by the beginning 
of the twentieth century, they were taxed heavily if
they did. If the state was constrained by its own 
logic of scientific forestry, the zamindars were
compelled by their imperatives of livelihood. And 
it seemed almost inevitable that sooner or later the
latter would question the legitimacy of the British 
acquiring their forests and pasturelands. <p>
 
The British regarded most of their problems of 
forest conservation arising from localresource-use.
<A NAME="R058"></A>
<A HREF="#N058">
<SUP>58</SUP></a>  
Given the steady population growth in the period 
under study, the reason for <p>

<b>++ Page 21 Grover</b><p>
 
&quot;over-use&quot; of forests can only 
be explained by the concomitantly decreased area of
regular resource-use, which in turn was a result 
of the conflict between the forest department and
the land revenue department. The forest department 
unsuccessfully tried to exclude people
by constructing physical barriers and imposing 
high fines on offenders. However, its efforts
at regulating forest rights fostered local opposition, 
both covert and overt, at every stage. The intrusive
leviathan had its limitations and the effectiveness 
of the forest policies was greatly dependent on the
reception of the local populace. Forest policies, 
in practice at the local level, were thus quite different
from what was envisaged at the state level. <p>
 
Let us begin with the <i><b>Gaddis,</i></b> who 
questioned the codification and regulation of
their rights. They petitioned time and again against 
what they considered unjust laws.
<A NAME="R059"></A>
<A HREF="#N059">
<SUP>59</SUP></a>   While migrating, they
could not halt at one place for more than one night 
without the permission of the Assistant
Commissioner, and they had to travel at least 
five miles every day.
<A NAME="R060"></A>
<A HREF="#N060">
<SUP>60</SUP></a>  They protested against this
five-mile rule, arguing that it was difficult for 
them to gauge the distances accurately.  Sick and injured
animals, as well as rain, delayed their movements. 
The <i><b>Gaddis</i></b> were concerned about
obtaining grazing rights in demarcated forests near 
villages during their halts.
<A NAME="R061"></A>
<A HREF="#N061">
<SUP>61</SUP></a>  The fact <p>

<b>++ Page 22 Grover</b><p>
 
that the <i><b>Gaddis </i></b>required more 
time to go up to the alpine regions than coming down
to the Kangra division was never really considered. 
Altitude, it seemed, was not considered a factor. <p>
 
In effect, though, the colonial state ensured 
that the pastoral cycle was regulated in terms 
of time and space. The state did not welcome 
unauthorized movement. It was clear that sedentarization
was a colonial objective. Not only did state 
spaces have to be legible, but people had to be
fixed to a given place as well.
<A NAME="R062"></A>
<A HREF="#N062">
<SUP>62</SUP></a>  The biggest 
problem for the nomads was not the thinness of their
material existence, but the enormous changes 
taking place around them.
<A NAME="R063"></A>
<A HREF="#N063">
<SUP>63</SUP></a>  Their 
relationship to their environment was even 
more complicated because they were
simultaneously dependent on land, forests, 
and pastures as they moved from one subsistence base to
another, largely determined by the rhythms 
of the season. But now, as grasslands gave way to pastures, 
and pastures to feedlot, their network of 
social and economic relations was greatly 
undermined.  The restrictions on <i><b>Gaddis'</i></b> 
movements also had consequences for local communities,
since agricultural and pastoral activities operated 
on a similar schedule. <p>
 
The land-holding zamindars first resorted to 
invoking the responsibility of the 
 government through formal petitions. For 
instance in a rather detailed appeal made to the 
 Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, Charles 
Montogmery Rivaz the <i><b>zamindars 
</i></b>of Kangra expressed their dissatisfaction 
with Anderson's Report, and listed 
20 grievances which ranged from appeals to 
stop public sale of dry trees from 
all demarcated and undemarcated forests, 
increasing the <p>

<b>++ Page 23 Grover</b><p>
 
number of Ail trees for local building purposes, 
to extending the number of nights Gaddis could stay
for the livestock to manure their fields.
<A NAME="R064"></A>
<A HREF="#N064">
<SUP>64</SUP></a>  Several 
right-holders also objected to the fact that although
they were entitled to timber at concessional rates, 
there were repeated delays in giving timber, and often
the timber was to be collected from remote localities. 
For instance in Rupi and Seraj, all trees marked
for grants were only distributed after three to six 
months.
<A NAME="R065"></A>
<A HREF="#N065">
<SUP>65</SUP></a>  Further delays occurred due to
distributions being often held in the winter. This 
made it necessary to wait until the snow had melted
before the trees could be marked in the high-altitude 
forests. Furthermore, charcoal burning by the
forest department interfered with local rights as 
it rapidly diminished the supply of <i><b>khushu
</i></b>oak, leaves of which villagers had free 
access to use as fodder. <p>
 
The Lieutenant Governor forwarded the 
complaints to the Deputy Commissioner of Kangra.
<A NAME="R066"></A>
<A HREF="#N066">
<SUP>66</SUP></a>  The
manner in which the Deputy Commissioner of 
Kulu responded to the detailed list of complaints was
quite dismissive. He concluded his reply by 
stating that had these complaints been addressed to him, he
would have taken steps to redress any legitimate 
grievances that were consistent with scientific forest
management. Given the fact that they were 
addressed to a visiting official showed that the
&quot;petitions were largely the work of a 
few 'irreconcilable malcontents'
<A NAME="R067"></A>
<A HREF="#N067">
<SUP>67</SUP></a>  who wished to give
everybody as much trouble as possible.&quot;
<A NAME="R068"></A>
<A HREF="#N068">
<SUP>68</SUP></a>   
In another instance, <p>

<b>++ Page 24 Grover</b><p>
 
the British response was not so much dismissive 
as patronizing, clearly reflected in a note
written by the Commissioner of the Jalandhar 
Division, Rai Bahadur Pandit Hari Kishan Kaul, to the 
Deputy Commissioner: <p>
 
<blockquote>In Kulu I was assailed by numerous 
deputations and received dozens of petitions. There is no doubt
that the people are obsessed by the idea that the 
forests originally belonged to them and that the
Government has usurped them. ..in the old days 
the exploitation of forests was not systematic and
whenever a Raja had trees cut down and sold 
the zamindars were able to get a good deal out of it either
by working at the fellings, or by stealing wood. 
On the contrary they are now completely shut out of
the forests and get precious little out of them.
<A NAME="R069"></A>
<A HREF="#N069">
<SUP>69</SUP></a></blockquote>
 
The British--circumvented as they were by a host 
of such local issues--continued with their legitimizing
ideology of scientific forestry, as clearly 
enunciated by Baden-Powell, Conservator 
of Forests, Punjab in his instructions: <p>
 
<blockquote>..when people apply for land to cultivate, 
we shall say, 'certainly, I will go and lay down a line for you,
that will be forest, and outside you may cultivate 
as you please.' In this way gradually forest after forest
will become demarcated..without creating a row. 
<A NAME="R070"></A>
<A HREF="#N070">
<SUP>70</SUP></a></blockquote>
 
The British were unwilling to address grievances. 
They 'dealt wish' protest rather then 'respond' <p>

Back <a href="#top">to the top</a><br>
<b>++ Page 25 Grover</b><p> 
 
to it.
<A NAME="R071"></A>
<A HREF="#N071">
<SUP>71</SUP></a>  These &quot;murmurs&quot; by the local 
elite was one expression of local discontent. <p>
 
The issue of who benefited and who lost in 
the commoditization of timber is a complex one. In the
process of increasing state regulation over forests, 
the landholding community certainly acquired more
rights to forests.
<A NAME="R072"></A>
<A HREF="#N072">

one-third share from the sale of forest proceeds from
unreserved forests. In 1917, Assistant Commissioner 
Feyson allowed the owners of private forests to
sell their trees for payment of bona fide debts.

A section of landowners in the Kangra region 
also took advantage of the commercial sale of 
trees, especially from the 1930s when transport 
became more affordable. Many villagers cleared 
their private lands and sold timber in the nearby 
markets, subject to approval by the local Deputy <p>

<b>++ Page 26 Grover</b><p> 
 
Commissioner.
<A NAME="R074"></A>
<A HREF="#N074">
<SUP>74</SUP></a>  The dominant communities also 
side-stepped colonial laws by diversifying 
their economic interests. For instance, once a 
market developed for livestock products by the 
third quarter of the nineteenth century, sheep 
farming became very popular in the Kangra 
district.
<A NAME="R075"></A>
<A HREF="#N075">
<SUP>75</SUP></a><p>
 
Between 1890 and 1894, livestock had increased 
by 12 per cent. The villagers were largely paying
their revenue from the proceeds of surplus stock, 
and making money by supplying the local wool
industry and the Shimla meat market.
<A NAME="R076"></A>
<A HREF="#N076">
<SUP>76</SUP></a>  The first 
Financial Commissioner, J.M. Douie, tabulated the

Amritsar butchers drew a considerable amount 
of their meat supply from Kangra proper.

There were also instances of villagers who bought 
small pieces of land on the main range of the 
Dhauladhar to acquire grazing rights. Furthermore, 
villagers also started selling wood and grass 
at towns such as Dharmasala, Kangra, Sujanpur, 
Haripur, Nurpur, and even at Pathankot in 
Gurdaspur.

The increase in the production of ghi can also 
be viewed as a metaphor for another kind of life that
existed in the region. In almost all the tahsils of 
Debra and Hamirpur, and in the Kutlehr jagir, the
land-holding cultivators started keeping 
buffaloes in order to produce ghi for sale. 
These were exceptionally wealthy men who also 
required a great deal of milk for their ownconsumption.
<A NAME="R082"></A>
<A HREF="#N082">
<SUP>82</SUP></a> 
Hundreds of man (eighty-two pounds equals one man) 
of ghi were exported from Changar to
Jwalamukhi town (in Kangra) in which over a 
thousand man of ghi were consumed annually by
pilgrims for offerings at the Siddhida (or Ambika) 
Goddess Temple. Ghi also acquired a market in the
Hoshiarpur district. <p>
 
Many of finials asserted that villagers were 
extending their pastoral pursuits at the expense of forests.
Clearly, by the end of the century pastoral wealth 
had increased significantly, and grazing had entered
a new phase of revenue generation. With the increase 
in the commercial <p>

<b>++ Page 29 Grover</b><p>
 
demand for timber and other forest-related products, 
the local populace had the ability to adopt novel
strategies to profit from such market demand. It is true 
that the tenurial system of zamindari did not
encourage the growth or protection of trees.
<A NAME="R083"></A>
<A HREF="#N083">
<SUP>83</SUP></a>  But then, 
just as maintaining large livestock holdings
became commonplace, one can argue that a similarly 
enterprising system of harvesting trees on private
forest plantations for the market could have also 
evolved.
<A NAME="R084"></A>
<A HREF="#N084">
<SUP>84</SUP></a>  
The involvement of the people as
producers for sale had a precedence. They had 
become buyers from the colonial state; buyers of timber
if their forest demand exceeded the colonial 
precepts of their requirements. They could also have
become sellers given suitable opportunities.
<A NAME="R085"></A>
<A HREF="#N085">

The forest department tried to curb grazing by 
introducing new experimentalregulations.
<A NAME="R086"></A>
<A HREF="#N086">
<SUP>86</SUP></a>   The
department soon gave up experimenting and 
imposed high grazing taxes.

<A HREF="#N087">
<SUP>87</SUP></a><p>

<b>++ Page 30 Grover</b><p>
 
The government sanctioned the imposition
 of a grazing tax in 1913. A conference was convened 
in 1914 in which orders were issued postponing 
the imposition of the tax on the buffaloes of 
<i><b>zamindars </i></b>until a scheme could 
be worked out to tax only the surplus animals kept in
excess of  the legitimate domestic requirements 
of the owners. The tax on sheep and goats was 
confirmed.
<A NAME="R088"></A>
<A HREF="#N088">
<SUP>88</SUP></a>  
In 1916, as an economic deterrent 
for zamindars keeping cattle, the government 
decided to levy a cattle tax on profits that 
accrued from grazing sheep and goats.
<A NAME="R089"></A>
<A HREF="#N089">
<SUP>89</SUP></a>   
This led to a steady reduction in the number 
of cattle kept by local landholders.

This was due to the inevitable antagonism between 
the pressure of a relatively dense population 
and the essential conservation of the forests in these 
low hills, not only for the protection of the 
rich agricultural lands in the plains, but also to 
meet the needs of the local neighboring population for
timber and firewood.
<A NAME="R096"></A>
<A HREF="#N096">
<SUP>96</SUP></a>  
Furthermore, given the 
market for timber, many of what the colonial state
treated as 'thefts' were also activities undertaken 
for sale in the local markets. So, besides an act of 
redemption for what the villagers perceived to be their
arbitrarily-deprived customary rights, 'theft' was 
also an entrepreneurial act to obtain and sell timber
'illegally.'
<A NAME="R097"></A>
<A HREF="#N097">
<SUP>97</SUP></a>  
In an era of non-mechanized transport, 
villagers were quite successful in using animals to
take away heavy pieces of timber. A letter by the 
Inspector-General of Police, Punjab is indicative of
the widespread timber theft: <p>
 
<blockquote>...Practically the whole of the villages 
along the rivers obtain their wood from the rivers, 
and, were a special body of Police appointed, 
the fact of their deputation would at once 
become known, and the people would suspend 
their thieving operations until they went 
away again.
<A NAME="R098"></A>
<A HREF="#N098">
<SUP>98</SUP></a></blockquote>

The acts were usually committed by one or two villagers, 
but when entire logs were targeted, 
then many more people were involved, if not 
in the act itself, then in their colluding with and 
protecting the actual takers.
<A NAME="R099"></A>
<A HREF="#N099">
<SUP>99</SUP></a>  
This expression of 
village solidarity created what Peluso calls a <p>
 
<b>++ Page 34 Grover</b><p>
 
culture of conspiracy.
<A NAME="R100"></A>
<A HREF="#N100">
<SUP>100</SUP></a>   Without acknowledging 
crime as defined by the colonial state,
peasant  resistance attracted allies 
and sympathizers from within its own quarters.
<A NAME="R101"></A>
<A HREF="#N101">
<SUP>101</SUP></a><p>
 
Rather than identifying these thefts and frauds as 
mere signs of protest, let us follow the course of the
stolen timber to see what were they used for 
eventually. For, if the issue was only one of protest, then
timber should have been used only for subsistence 
needs, and marginally for commercial purposes.
But, the local communities were not reverting to 
an archaic past. They had devised ingenious ways to
use the timber. They either stamped timber with 
forged &quot;sold&quot; marks and then sold it in the
open market.
<A NAME="R102"></A>
<A HREF="#N102">
<SUP>102</SUP></a>  
Or they sawed the timber and sold 
it at the nearest market at a much cheaper rate, or
concealed it in the ground for a few months before 
it was considered safe to dispose it of. Sometimes
the villagers put two or even three roofs on their 
houses in an attempt to conceal as much timber as
possible. After a year or two, when the timber was 
sufficiently weathered to avoid detection, the
villagers sold whole houses, roofs, and posts to 
outsiders for considerable sums.
<A NAME="R103"></A>
<A HREF="#N103">
<SUP>103</SUP></a>  
They also carried
timber to small market towns and sold it to petty 
shopkeepers who could easily remove the ownership
marks and saw them up with other <p>

<b>++ Page 35 Grover</b><p>
 
timber.
<A NAME="R104"></A>
<A HREF="#N194">
<SUP>104</SUP></a>  
The more entrepreneurial ones, whom 
the British referred to as &quot;the bolder
spirits,&quot; bought a little timber from Wazirabad 
or Sialkot, brought it to their villages, and opened
small timber shops which acted as a cover for the 
owner to sell stolen timber. The timber the owner had
legally bought was kept carefully and produced 
whenever any official came to questionhim.
<A NAME="R105"></A>
<A HREF="#N105">
<SUP>105</SUP></a>  
The forest department report of 1902-03 showed a loss 
of 32 per cent of government scantlings on the
Chenab and 18 per cent on the Sutlej in a decade. 
On the Jhelum the loss was12 per cent up to 1904,
and it rose as high as 45 per cent in 1906. During 
the four years ending1909, the private firm of
Spedding and Company alone lost more than 
Rs. 100,000 worth of scantlings to theft.
<A NAME="R106"></A>
<A HREF="#N106">
<SUP>106</SUP></a><p>
 
In fact, forest officials admitted that 'organized 
thefts' of timber on the Punjab rivers, especially on the
Chenab and Jhelum were so widespread that 
special measures were called for quite outside the ambit of
the prevailing Forest Act.
<A NAME="R107"></A>
<A HREF="#N107">
<SUP>107</SUP></a>  
Such 'thefts' had 
occupied British interests since the late 1860s.
Suggestions had been forwarded to empower 
forest officers with judicial authority. This implied that
forest officers could enter residential premises 
to search for stolen timber, since it was felt that the time
taken by the police in searches was always too long <p>
 
<b>++ Page 36 Grover</b><p>
 
which gave in turn the thieves time to dispose of 
the stolen timber.
<A NAME="R108"></A>
<A HREF="#N108">
<SUP>108</SUP></a>  
But these suggestions were not
accepted by the Punjab government.
<A NAME="R109"></A>
<A HREF="#N109">
<SUP>109</SUP></a>  
In fact  the difficulty for the government 
was to prove that it
was government timber, that it was stolen, and 
that the possessor knew or had reason to believe it to be
stolen.
<A NAME="R110"></A>
<A HREF="#N110">
<SUP>110</SUP></a><p>
 
Concerns over 'timber theft' continued to dominate 
forest official debates, including the Punjab Forest
Conference held at Lahore in 1909.
<A NAME="R111"></A>
<A HREF="#N111">
<SUP>111</SUP></a>  
The issue was 
not only to control the transit of timber by river,
but it was also recognized that the control of its 
transit by land was imperative.
<A NAME="R112"></A>
<A HREF="#N112">
<SUP>112</SUP></a>  
The Punjab
Forest (Sale of Timber) Bill was subsequently 
passed by the Punjab Legislative Council in
1911 to control timber theft while in river transit.
<A NAME="R113"></A>
<A HREF="#N113">
<SUP>113</SUP></a>   
By this bill, forest officials essentially limited the
opportunities for theft of timber in transit by river. 
Villagers were not allowed to saw up timber at
places within a distance of three miles from the 
bank of a river.  The procedure for applying to do
otherwise was detailed and tedious, enough to 
dissuade most from applying. Also, all sale depots had to
be registered. However, as the subsequent forest <p>

<b>++ Page 37 Grover</b><p>
 
reports indicate, this was a problem that the 
forest department had to deal with regularly. In
sum, local communities not only refused to accept 
forest laws, as Pearson had vainly hoped; they also 
adopted ways to circumvent rules limiting their 
access to forest resources. <p>
 
Let me conclude here by suggesting that one 
can also employ the lens of a shadow economy to
problematize state-society dichotomy. Of course, 
one cannot dismiss the state nor its domination, for
local communities had to operate within and around 
laws. But the state was not monolithic with a
coherent logic to only collect revenue. The conflict 
between the forest and the land revenue
departments points to the disaggregated nature 
of the state. At the same time, one needs to go beyond
the politics of policy making and examine how 
the implementation of laws was embedded within a
societal context. The local landscape was marked 
by &quot;disperseddomination.&quot;
<A NAME="R114"></A>
<A HREF="#N114">
<SUP>114</SUP></a>  The
proliferation of informal timber markets clearly indicates 
that certain local communities created
autonomous spaces to evade some of the stringent 
state policies.
<A NAME="R115"></A>
<A HREF="#N115">
<SUP>115</SUP></a>  These communities used the
market for its benefits and along with local traders 
and timber dealers, created a widespread and active
network to partake in the benefits from the 
commoditization of timber. Howsoever subsumed or
fugitive its nature, this economy was also about profit. 
In other words, both state and society were not
fixed entities, but were mutually constituted. <p>

<A NAME="N006">6.</A> Local areas rarely 
bear the marks of only one 
form of socio-economic structure; they are the

of history which are sedimented over each other are
not just economic, but also cultural, political, and 
ideological. See Doreen Massey, <i><b>Spatial

<A NAME="N007">7.</A> I specifically examine 
the Kangra district which the 
British directly acquired from the Sikhs in
1849. Since Chamba and Bashahr were under 
the control of local rajas, the colonial state could not
introduce new land and forest settlements, 
although forest rights were restricted and specified in
appendices of forest leases between the rajas 
and the British. The only <i><b>deodar </i></b>forests
of any importance in the Punjab that belonged 
to the colonial government were situated in Hazara and in
Kulu. The forests in Hazara were the joint property of 
government and <i><b>zamindars</i></b>,and they
were not very extensive. Moreover, they were 
situated along the borders, and no forest officer
approached them except under the protection of 
a strong police guard; National Archives of India

<A NAME="N034">34.</A> Fire control 
was the other dominant 
concern of the colonial state. In fact fire control was
one of the first issues to be addressed 
in the first conference on forest administration in 1871-72.The
practice of setting annual fires to grass was 
considered important for a better undergrowth.  
The Forest Department felt that as long as a 
forest or 'wasteland' was burnt annually, its improvement was
stunted, its capacity to retain soil hampered, 
and its usefulness in regulating the surface drainage
compromised. See D. Brandis &amp; A. 
Smythies eds., <i><b>Report of the Proceedings of the Forest
Conference held at Simla</i></b>, October

of the Enclosure Movement 
in England which was designed to give greater
scope to improved methods of arable farming and 
sometimes to convert arable land into pasture. It
made farming subservient to the needs of the markets 
in which merchant capital dominated the scene.

within the local society and 
economy were being perpetually reorganized, even
though the initiative for many changes came from the 
British. Given the alterations in the factors of
production, the zamindars could have made a 
better use of opportunities, as clearly evident in the
tremendous increase of livestock; See Samuel

<A NAME="N085">85.</A> In Appalachian 
Kentucky, logging and farming 
were equally important to household subsistence in
pre-industrial families. Farmers provided most of the 
financing, labor, management and organization of
timber operations, while they depended on external 
markets and contacts with corporate mills and
industry to make a profit. Timber was called the 
Appalachian's staple crop. Timber species found in
this region were oak, walnut, chestnut and poplar.

Society in Appalachian Kentucky,1850-1915,&quot;

or one-third of the forest area was 
closed for a period of thirty years. No green wood could
be felled in the trihais except for state purposes. 
But since most trihais were located near village
settlements, the Forest Department found it difficult 
to prevent villagers from grazing their cattle in the
area, notwithstanding the heavy penalties and 
cattle pound charges levied on them. The fact that 
no part of the arable land in the hills was especially 
devoted to growing fodder for cattle (unlike in 
the plains) partially explains the position of both 
the state and the grazers.
