<font size="-1"><b>     The anomalous peasant mobilization of Kerala is rooted in
especially extensive structural transformations congruent with
Polanyi's notion of a "great transformation" and organizational
development centered on ratcheted episodes of reforms in landed and
other social relations in response. The culmination was appropriation
of rentier property (almost half the land in the state) and the end
of agrestic slavery and serfdom. Pre-political responses to
structural dislocation expressed moral outrage resulting in
self-consciously suicidal confrontations with the colonial state.
Inheritors of the agrarian radicalism tradition introduced
organizational and tactical innovations which more effectively
confronted a state traumatized by "fanatical outrages." Activists on
the left understood, as academics often do not, that there is no such
thing as a peasantry; creating an effective political aggregation of
individuals from agrarian classes with objectively opposed interests
and multiple identities requires political theory which integrates
structure and agency. As a group, the "peasantry" had divergent
interests which had to be submerged to effect collective action; the
integrating goal evolved into the abolition of landlordism, playing
on the most important structural feature of landlordism - the rent
fund. Presentation of landlordism 
<b><i>as a social system</i></b> permitted a
tactical integration of grievances across the spectrum of lived
experience in the villages. Disappearance of the rent fund through
appropriation by former tenants in the 1970s ruptured the agrarian
coalition, underlining the importance of this particular structural
fact to the historical aggregation process. Analytical unities across
these quite different episodes of social action suggest the utility,
and limits, of a collective action frame based on methodological
individualism.</b></font><p>

<blockquote>     Fanaticism of this violent type flourishes only upon sterile
soil. When the people are poor and discontented, it flourishes apace
like other crimes of violence. The grievous insecurity to which the
working ryots [peasants] are exposed by the existing system of landed
tenures is undoubtedly largely to blame for the impoverished and
discontented state of the peasantry, and a measure to protect the
ryot, of whatever class, is the means which seems to commend itself
the most for amelioration of their condition. With settled homesteads
and an assured income to all who are thrifty and industrious... it is
certain that fanaticism would die a natural death."<p>

     Wolf Ladejinsky wrote in 1951 that the American-induced land
reforms in Japan (in which he played a major role) "stole communist
thunder" and produced conditions of rural social stability and
political conservatism.<a name="rf01"></a><a href="#n_01_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
Like Barrington Moore, Jr., Doreen Warriner,
Gunnar Myrdal, and Samuel Huntington, Ladejinsky concluded that the
possibilities for radical land reform in India had passed; such
policies became a structural impossibility given the distribution of
political power in rural areas in independent India. Official
proclamations from Delhi have elaborately documented 2 the failure of
land reforms nationwide since the 1950s.
<a name="rf02"></a><a href="#n_02_"><sup>(2)</sup></a><p>

     An obvious puzzle is why radical reforms in the South Indian
state of Kerala not only remained on the agenda for generations, but
were effectively implemented in the teeth of powerful opposition in
the 1970s. The answer to that puzzle -- anomalous peasant
mobilization and political power -- poses another: how do we explain
Kerala's agrarian political exceptionalism? Though it is beyond the
scope of this paper, it seems clear as well that extraordinary social
mobilization is partly responsible for the extraordinary development
of Kerala in terms of human welfare -as measured by the Physical
Quality of Life index (literacy, life expectancy and infant
mortality) and comparable constructs -which places Kerala well above
the mean for India despite lower than average wealth per capita.<p>

     William Logan's views, quoted at the head of this essay,
represent one of the antinomies of the colonial logic of
understanding and managing agrarian discontent: "thrifty and
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 3]</b>

industrious" peasants with security have no inclination to organized
violence. Ladejinsky's cold-war perspective on "stealing thunder"
from the left via land reform explains the seemingly paradoxical
support for land reform from conservative positions -- during the
cold war, both the United States and the Soviet Union supported land
reform in their foreign policies, the United States more effectively.
Ladejinsky's self-consciously cold-war position coincides with
William Logan's world-view as a colonial official beset by organized
violence and crime in the nineteenth century.<p>

     William Logan's interpretations and prescriptions lost out in
politics within the colonial state to an alternative model of
causation ("religious fanaticism"), obviating his solution (land
reform) in the short run. Organized violence erupted on a larger
scale in Malabar decades later; eventually the colonial state began a
dialogue of reform which was carried by the communists to
mobilizational strength and electoral power as the first freely
elected communist government of any size in the world.<p>

     If the conservative logic of land reform (which dates from
antiquity) is well understood (Herring 1983), reformism from radical
political forces poses a puzzle. Resolution of the land question has
a strategic and tactical component. Since Lenin, there has been
explicit recognition in leftist agrarian theory of a contradiction
between the tactical imperative of promising land to the agrarian
underclasses and the strategic threat that successful land reform
will conservatize precisely those classes which form the tactical
roots of mobilizational success.<a name="rf03">
</a><a href="#n_03_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> In landlord-tenant systems of
importance in the areas of greatest communist electoral success in
India (Kerala and West Bengal), the issue presents the classic
dilemma for a radical party: the tactical means of organizing
political power carry the strategic potential of conservatizing, via
"embourgeoisement," radical social forces if implemented.
<a name="rf04"></a><a href="#n_04_"><sup>(4)</sup></a><p>

     The logic of embourgeoisement is not restricted to a leftist
project; the same embourgeoisement which is feared by the left is
promoted by the right. Samuel Huntington summarized a distinguished
lineage of social scientific lore in explicating the logic
underpinning conservative use of land reform promulgated by domestic
elites in crisis and by international elites concerned with
"containing communism:" "No social group is more conservative than a
land-owning peasantry, and none is more revolutionary than a
peasantry which owns too little land or pays too high a rental"
(1968: 375). This Janus-faced character of the peasantry is widely
recognized in social theory and realpolitik. Land reform as
conservatizing force was explicitly promoted not only by an isolated
colonial official facing insurrection, as in the case of William
Logan, by also by that strand of United States foreign policy which
sought to apply lessons from the "loss of China" to eradication of
"breeding 

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 4]</b> 

grounds" of communism in poor societies from Vietnam to El Salvador
(Prosterman and Riedinger 1987: Chapters 5, 6; McCoy 1971).<p>

     Land reform thus presents the agrarian left with a double-edged
sword: a mobilizing platform but simultaneously a threat to destroy
the social-structural niche which presents mobilizational potential.
Agrarian communism in India has diverged along exactly these lines of
analysis and opportunity. In Kerala, the left recognized the
potential threat of embourgeoisement but pressed for two decades to
abolish the landlord-tenant nexus with a land-to-the-tiller reform.
Rejecting land to the tiller, Bengal's communist movement has settled
for the land policy of conservative regimes: tenancy reform (Herring
1983:Chapter 2). The crucial difference politically is that tenants
in West Bengal remain dependent on political-administrative means to
retain quasi-proprietary claims (security of tenure) and
administratively rigged rents, whereas former tenants in Kerala after
a vigorously contested process, now hold titles to their land.
Leftists in Kerala took the risk and lost electorally; Bengali
communists implemented conservative tenure reforms that kept their
rural clientele dependent on the party and prospered at the polls.<p>

     This essay is centrally concerned with the puzzle of how
agrarian collective action is sustained. But agrarian structure,
movements and state responses, but the agrarian issue stands as an
important illustration of a broader theme: the communists outflanked
the Congress party from which they split and with which they
contested for power on rural redistributive policy, and in the
process mobilized a powerful political force from radical agrarian
classes (Herring 1988). The communists could credibly make and
eventually deliver on those promises precisely because they lacked
the ideological and class-based constraints which rendered the
Congress -- in Kerala and elsewhere in India - incapable of
overturning the rural social structure as so often promised in
official discourse. The theoretical implication is that not all is
choice, even for political entrepreneurs (contrary to Lichbach 1994;
Popkin 1079: Ch 6). Simultaneously, the mode of mobilization in
Kerala put significant constraints on the forms of public law that
could result from mobilization; the "middle-peasant" tenants who
earned the condemnation of agricultural laborers in the post-reform
era were the leaders and object of leftist organization in the 1920s
and 1930s, in which the shock troops were the landless laborers.<p>

     Communist leaders themselves attribute a great deal of their
electoral success to mobilization of a radical peasant movement, but
there are other crucial issues on which the Communist Party may be
said to have stolen Congress thunder in the political process,
including what is frequently called "nationalism."
<a name="rf05"></a><a href="#n_05_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> As on
agrarian-reform issues, the communists took a consistently

more militant and uncompromising stance on the ending of European
occupation. Likewise, the communists proved more militant and
effective in carrying out the Congress pledge to improve the
condition of "untouchable" groups, to implement policies providing
local-level input into the administrative system, to decentralize
political power and even to uphold high standards of personal
integrity and austerity in public life. on all of these issues, as in
agrarian reform, the willingness of Congress politicians to
compromise with powerful interests generated by the existing social
structure contrasted markedly with communist efforts to transform
that structure.<p>

     The departure of this essay from much of the literature is its
insistence that the political theory of activists matters -- and that
this organic, <b><i>practical</i></b> theory of mobilization is consistent with
strands of its-academic shadow. It assumes that the structure-agency
dichotomy is infructuous: there can be no account of choice without
systematic attention to structure, nor do structures have causal
power absent the choices of individuals. These choices in turn cannot
be understood absent attention to ideational structures, both
normative and empirical, which matter fundamentally. Leftist leaders
in Kerala understood these points even if academics often do not.<p>

<b><a name="theg">The Great Transformation in Malabar: overview</a></b><p>

     The idea of a great transformation as a cause of peasant
radicalism derives from Karl Polanyi's (1957) notion of the
disruptive effects of the emergence of the market from social
relations in which the market was previously "embedded." Though
unequal and often degrading, pre-market society was characterized by
understandings of the normative basis of allocative mechanisms. The
fundamental insight of Polanyi should not be to romanticize
pre-market society, but to underline the enormity of the normative
transformation necessary to accommodate the market as a disembedded
allocative device. The "moral economy" model of peasant radicalism
took off from this insight (Booth 1994). Yet obviously not all
instances of market transformation give rise to peasant radicalism.
Some disaggregation is necessary.<p>

     The present state of Kerala was formed in 1956 from three
distinct regions; differences in regional social structure and
history are important in explaining the growth and uneven development
of a radical agrarian movement. Of particular importance is the
history of agrarian relations in Malabar, the northern-most region.
First, the communist party struck its deepest organizational roots in
Malabar, and the more radical factions of the undivided (pre-1964)
party originated there. Secondly, Malabar was under direct colonial
rule as part of the Madras Presidency; the other two regions,
Travancore and Cochin, were under indirect rule through maharajahs
until Independence. Malabar thus evidenced long direct competition
within the anti- 

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 6]</b>

colonial movement between those who became leaders of the Indian
National Congress and those who eventually split from the Congress to
found the Communist Party in the state.<p>

     Malabar offers an historical example of a theoretically
expected outcome: development of a radical mass-based political party
within a structural niche for a party with the social theory and
organizational capacity to convert those objective conditions into
political power. Yet this outcome was in no sense preordained.<p>

     Malabar under colonial rule became in many ways the archetypal
disintegrating agrarian system, earning, as one colonial officer
said, "the unenviable reputation of being the most rack-rented place
on the face of the earth" (Varghese, 1970:78). With the introduction
of colonial law, particularly the imposition of a legal system based
on the absolute notion of land as private property, traditional
overlords were able to evict tenants and raise rents according to the
familiar rule of "what the market would bear," enforced by the police
powers of a colonial state . Clearly the great transformation from
above was one in which property claims were disentangled from their
broader social moorings, and thus functions. As courts and
administrative law protected the property claims of landlords, the
necessity of good patron-client relations diminished; control of
economic assets was guaranteed by higher authority.
<a name="rf06"></a><a href="#n_06_"><sup>(6)</sup></a><p>

     Property institutions were central not only to William Logan's
view of the Mappila uprisings, but also to participants. Though there
is considerable dispute on the issue of whether or not private
property in land existed in precolonial Kerala, there is no dispute
that land control was hedged by social institutions to a marked
degree -- "embedded in social relations," in Polanyi's (1957)
formulation. Prior to the 9th Century, one-third of the gross produce
of landholders was due the king as what may be conceptualized as
either a rent or tax. Central authority dissolved in the 9th Century,
giving way to a decentralized prebendial feudalism.<a name="rf07">
</a><a href="#n_07_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> From 825 AD
until the Mysorean invasions (1766-1792), the King's share
(<b><i>rajabhogam</i></b>, more 
generally conceptualized as <i><b>pattam</b></i>)<a name="rf08">
</a><a href="#n_08_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> came to be
shared equally by the ultimate landholder, 
or <b><i>janmakkaran</i></b> (<b><i>janmi</i></b>),
and a subordinate known as 
<b><i>kanakkaran</i></b>, whose control of the land
intertwined elements of usufructuary mortgage and tenancy.<p>

     These titles came to connote "landlord" and "superior tenant"
after the reorganization of land rights under colonial rule, but the
original meanings clearly connote "embeddedness" in Polanyi's sense.
The hierarchy of rights in land replicated the hierarchy of social
standing (Dhanagare 1977:112-114). <b><i>Janmakkaran</i></b> is usually held to
have derived from <b><i>janmam</i></b> 
("birth right"), <b><i>kanakkaran</i></b> from <b><i>kan</i></b> ( "the
eye," related to the Dravidian root <b><i>kanuku</i></b> "to see") connoting
oversight functions.

 
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 7]</b> 

Holders of <b><i>kanam</i></b> rights 
were so clearly associated with specific
caste status in some parts of Kerala 
that the <b><i>Keralolpatti</i></b> explicitly
identifies the Nair caste as people of "the eye," the "hand" and "the
order," whose duty it was to "prevent the rights from being curtailed
or suffered to fall into disuse" (Logan 1887: 1, 670). So clearly
were the Nairs identified with supervisory functions in the
feudal system that Logan rightly observes: "they had as a guild
higher functions in the body politic than merely ploughing the
rice-fields and controlling the irrigated lands (ibid.).11<p>

     Since the Nair guild had "higher functions" than
cultivation, other social strata were necessarily defined by the
lower functions of labor on the land. In the traditional tenurial
structure, the net produce was shared out in thirds: one-third to
the <b><i>janmi</i></b> (a share the British perceived as rent proper), one-
third to the <b><i>kanakkaran</i></b> (the supervising intermediary, often a
mortgagee, whom the British interpreted as the "tenant"), and
one-third to those who actually worked the land -- laborers
(<b><i>koolikar</i></b>) known as <b><i>tiyyas</i></b> 
or <b><i>cherumar</i></b> after their caste
(actually jati) identification. Much of this labor was performed
by individuals understood to be slaves by colonial authorities,
but it was a form of slavery quite unlike that of the
transatlantic chattel business. Baden-Powell described South
Indian slaves as 
<b><i>glebae adscripti</i></b>, whose position was both
circumscribed and secure. "Brahmans and moneylenders" may be
"swept away before the fury of a Muhammadan invasion... 11 but
"no one molests or moves the slave: whoever may be the nominal
owner, or whatever the circumstances of the time, they are safe
in their insignificance, and continue, and will ever continue, to
till the ground their ancestors have tilled before them
"(Baden-Powell 1892 Vol 111:121).<p>

     The result of new forms of property and new claims of taxing
authority was a series of quite serious agrarian uprisings,
beginning in Malabar in 1836, initially peaking in 1841, and
continuing sporadically throughout the nineteenth century
(Radhakrishnan 1989:42-82). Simmering agrarian tensions exploded
in 1921 in a series of encounters known as the Moplah (Mappila)
Rebellion, one of the most intense uprisings in Indian colonial
history. Scholarly and official interpretations isolated three
causes for the uprising, emphasis varying by account. The revolt
was simultaneously a revolt with "communal" overtones--Muslims
(moplahs) rising against Hindu overlords-- and a class revolt by
unusually exploited tenants against landlords, and simultaneously
a political revolt against severe repression by a colonial
state.<a name="rf09"></a><a href="#n_09_"><sup>(9)</sup></a><p>

     The first discussion of land reform was generated within the
colonial administration in (contested) recognition of the
tenurial base of peasant violence. Colonial discourse was
acrimoniously divided on the issue of causation; an orientalist 

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 8]</b> 

focus on "religious fanaticism," associated with the views of
T.L. Strange, was contested by a countervailing theme of tenure-
induced immiserization associated with William Logan. The latter
worldview promoted agrarian reform; fear of rural instability
preceded concerns for production and social equity in discussions
of land reform which were to continue intermittently for a
century.<p>

     The Mappila uprisings did not spawn continuing organization
or lasting political projects, but were more in the character of
<b><i>jacqueries</i></b>. <a name="rf10">
</a><a href="#n_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> 
Defeat of the final uprising in 1921 led to
conservatism and political withdrawal among Muslim peasants (Panikkar
1989:190). The legacy of the uprisings was an opening for tenure
reform in elite discourse, conditioned by fear of agrarian rebellion.
That opening provided the focal point for continually escalating
peasant demands in dialectical relation to state intransigence,
resulting in an overturning of the agrarian system through public law
in the 1970s.<p>

Back <a href="#top">to the top</a>.<p>

<b><a name="inch">Inchoate Radicalism: The Mappila Uprisings</a></b><p>

     Invasions from Islamic Mysore in the 18th century caused a mass
exodus of the Hindu superordinates from Malabar. Muslim tenants
(primarily <b><i>verumpattakar</i></b>)<a name="rf11"></a>
<a href="#n_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> 
then ceased paying rent, and there was
general upward mobility of Muslims into positions occupied previously
by Hindus. Because of the preceding centuries of decentralized
political structure, it was widely held that actual cultivators in
Kerala had not experienced any land revenue claim from the state
(Logan 1887:1,672). Consequently, the experientially novel claims of
British taxation joined the novel forms of property entailed in
British misreading of property relations as a source of moral
outrage.<p>

     British control of Malabar was established in 1792 following a
costly war with Mysore. The immediate problem for the state was
establishing a social base for their authority and recovering the war
costs via tax collections. Land taxation requires identifiable
property rights; in recognizing the Nair and Namboodiri claimants as
"lords of the soil," the British effectively restored "the landed
aristocracy of Nambudiri 
<b><i>jenmis</i></b> and Nayars" (Dhanagare 1977:118).
Land taxes were over the course of the century recognized by
subordinate colonial officials as excessive. Not only was the tax
burden heavy, but its incidence was unequal; less well-connected
villagers were over-assessed, the well-connected lightly assessed
(Panikkar 1989:7). Within the landlord-tenant dyad, land revenue
ultimately became the tenant's burden, concentrating the social pain
of taxation both on weaker owners and on tenants in particular
(ibid:11). As a consequence of the settlement, holdings in Malabar
were far more concentrated than in the rest of Madras Presidency and
the extent of landlessness much greater (Karat 1973; Dhanagare
1977:118-119).

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 9]</b><p>

     Revenue imperatives were not limited to solutions through land
taxation, but included taxation of numerous items of importance to
the poor and to the establishment of official monopolies and
fixed-price procurement of commodities. Monopolies on salt, timber
and tobacco increased unemployment in those sectors, thus increasing
agrarian pressure .<a name="rf12">
</a><a href="#n_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> By 
1849, salt and tobacco monopolies yielded
half the value of land revenue, compared to less than 10 percent in
the period 1809-1813.<a name="rf13">
</a><a href="#n_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> 
Among the fifty or so specific taxes
collected, particularly abhorrent were those on items necessary for
livelihoods: shops, cattle, looms, tapping knives, fishing nets,
ferries, etc. Panikkar notes that "nothing" fell outside the colonial
state's taxation net (1989: 17). Colonial officials recognized that
these taxes, though essential for fiscal reasons, were particularly
"obnoxious." Sullivan reported in 1843:<p>

     <blockquote>     The ferry tax is more obnoxious than the tobacco tax. The poor
     woman whose livelihood depends upon the bundle of sticks which
     she is carrying cannot pass until she has paid. So hardly does
     this tax press upon the lower orders that lives have been lost
     in attempting to swim the river for the purpose of avoiding
     it.<a name="rf14"></a>
     <a href="#n_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a></blockquote><p>

     The unequal incidence of taxation, and the proliferations of
non-landed assessments undermine Menon's (1994) revisionist claim
that land revenues declined as a percentage of produce in Malabar.
Taxes and administered price monopolies combined with land revenue
assessments (and indeed increased because of reluctance to raise the
land tax further) to create considerable misery. H.S. Graeme observed
in 1822 that, in contrast to earlier reports on the relative absence
of poverty in Malabar,<p>

      <blockquote>"the province swarms with beggars, and it may not unreasonably
     be ascribed to their comforts having seriously encroached upon
     by the salt and tobacco monopolies, and to the trade of the
     weavers having been nearly exterminated... and to the trade in
     timber also abolished by the monopoly of that article."<a name="rf15"></a>
     <a href="#n_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a></blockquote><p>

     Resulting agrarian violence was expressed in the idiom of
Islamic community and identity; the "Mappila (sometimes "Moplah"
[indigenous Muslim]) outrages" which broke out during the nineteenth
century were couched in oppositional terms of a Muslim community
against a European state and Hindu landlords (Dale 1980; Arnold
1982). uprisings began in 1836 and continued sporadically until the
final dramatic outburst in 1921. The 1921 uprising was denounced by
Gandhi as a perversion of the nationalist Khilafat cause he
championed, but was nevertheless characterized in the District
Gazetteer as "a gigantic popular upheaval the like of which has not
been seen in Kerala before or since."<a name="rf16"></a>
<a href="#n_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 10]</b> <p>

     The original colonial diagnosis of the uprisings was "religious
fanaticism"<a name="rf17"></a><a href="#n_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> 
because of the modes of organization, symbolism and
ethnicity of participants and victims. Mappilas believed that to kill
a landlord was not only no sin, but a source of religious merit; to
die fighting the colonial state in <b><i>jihad </i></b>ensured the benefits of
martyrdom. Conrad Wood (1978:133) goes so far as to argue that "the
defining characteristic of the Moplah outbreak was devotion to
death."<p>

     The countervailing line within the colonial state was that of
District Collector and Magistrate William Logan (1887:692):<p>

     <blockquote>The real fact seems to have been that the janmis, influenced
     partly by the rise in prices of produce and partly by the novel
     views of the courts as their real position, had at last begun
     to feel their power as <b><i>Lords of the Soil</i></b> and to exercise it
     through the courts. The <b><i>Mappillas</i></b>, who had been peacefully in
     possession of the lands since the time of Hyder Ali's conquest,
     felt it no doubt as a bitter grievance that the janmis should
     have obtained the power to evict them -- a power which did not
     intrinsically belong to them -- and the influential men among
     them, looking about for means to protect themselves, set
     fanaticism in motion..."</blockquote><p>

     The original controversy, between T.L. Strange and William
Logan, persisted beyond their active involvement. The Malabar
District Superintendent of Police reaffirmed the religious-fanaticism
view in his confidential report on the 1921 rebellion:<p>

     <blockquote>"These outbreaks, being in the name of religion, proved
     infectious and had an unsettling effect on the neighborhood,
     requiring little to induce any poverty-stricken Mappilla to
     seek a glorious death as an entrance to such a paradise as his
     ignorant religious teachers pictured for him... (Hitchcock
     1925:10)."</blockquote><p>

     Though debate among modern scholars has reproduced the colonial
discourse opposing religious fanaticism to tenurial grievances,
<a name="rf18"></a><a href="#n_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> it
seems clear that the two explanations are inextricably
intertwined. The purely religious interpretation as ideational
motivation fails because Muslims elsewhere were not prone to the
sorts of "fanaticism" represented continuously in Malabar over
almost a century. The responsive critique that not all tenants
were Muslims in Malabar, nor were all martyrs tenants, is not
persuasive because it fails to consider alternative methods of
protest (individualized "weapons of the weak" and organized
banditry) and the effect of tenancy disasters on both larger
families<a name="rf19"></a><a href="#n_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> 
and the community in general. Tenant evictions,
whether or not directly experienced, symbolized new and
subjectively illegitimate power relations; generalized
destitution symbolized the novel powers of taxation, punitive
fines and restriction of economic opportunity of an alien state.
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 11]</b> <p>

     Where Islam provides a more persuasive explanation is in
providing solutions to the collective action problem that
frequently prevents agrarian rebellion. David Arnold correctly
argues, following Logan in part, that not only did the mosque
provide "a focus of loyalty and a centre for collective action"
but the Islamic expression of outrage manifested "a new
collective, almost familial, solidarity and mutual
supportiveness... Islam offered a language of redemption, a crude
egalitarianism, an antipathy to landlords and foreigners, a kind
of institutionalized inversion, or the everyday world of the
peasants (1982:262-263)." That the great transformation occurred
under British rule following the restoration of a landed
aristocracy previously defeated at the hands of co-religionists
reinforced messianic tendencies so familiar in peasant rebellion
(e.g. Little 1989:15off).<p>

     Martyrdom as motivation may have facilitated collective
confrontation, but simultaneously undermined prospects for
effectiveness. As a leader of a Mappila unit in 1849 awaited the
arrival of more troops, he stated that he was ready to die in
"fair fight with the Cirkar (state]" (Wood 1978:151). This was a
common theme of 19th Century rebels. Meeting soldiers of the raj
as equals in the deadly game of combat symbolically inverted the
subordination and humiliation felt by destitute Muslims.<p>

     Oligopsonistic land markets and powers to impoverish or
evict tenants spilled over into denial of life chances symbolized
by constriction of even religious practice. A spokesman for the
gang involved in the 1851 outbreak commented on the difficulty
experienced by local Muslims in purchasing a piece of land for a
mosque: "what is the loss to the Nairs and Namboodris if a piece
of ground capable of sowing five Parrahs of seed be allotted for
construction of a Mosque? Let those hogs [the British soldiers]
come here, we are resolved to die."<a name="rf20"></a>
<a href="#n_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a><p>

     The tenurial decay noted by Logan and the Mappilas was not a
discrete event, but rather signified multiplex and gradual
changes in power relations -- changes which were resisted by
violence on both sides of the tenurial dyad in Malabar (Menon
1994:14, passim). Evictions were symptomatic of these new power
relations and of the state's support of some rights over others.
Eviction is an <b><i>economic</i></b> problem only in those situations in which
superior or equal alternatives are not available. Given the
economic changes of Malabar in the 19th century, mobilization on
tenurial issues was inescapably symbolic of economic desperation,
and, more importantly, of broader power relations centrally
involving the state. That landlords were the targets of looting,
violence and coerced "gifts" or protection money indicates not
only that they alone had the resources to loot in a declining
agrarian system, but also stood symbolically for unacceptable
market powers and the state which guaranteed them.
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 12]</b> <p>

     As the "religious" interpretation correctly stresses, Islam
provided a mode of organization and a sense of community
buttressed by historical relative deprivation. The "itinerate
preachers" of colonial discourse were central to mobilization and
the mosque as regular gathering place of a community facilitated
communication and organization. Lacking these means of collective
action, the Hindu population in the 19th century largely turned
to more individualistic "weapons of the weak" (Scott 1985),
including theft and dacoity. That Muslims were prominent in
organized violence indicates that their solidarity as a community
and ideology of martyrdom provided means of responding to social
distress different from those of other communities. Moreover, the
ritual and social differentiation within the Hindu community
created additional obstacles to collective protest, obstacles
which were overcome only through strategic innovations of the
leftists in the 1920s and 1930s (Herring 1988 and below).<p>

     Conditions in the 1921 rebellion were considerably
different. Support from the Congress for the Khilafat agitation
and for self-rule provided both external allies (putatively) and
new leadership. That rising lasted six months and extended over
two thousand square miles until superior military resources of
the state effected a brutal suppression.<a name="rf21"></a>
<a href="#n_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a><p>

     Strangely enough, we have a fairly accurate interpretation
implicitly recognizing the synthesis between competing material
and ideational interpretations of 
the Mappila <b><i>jacqueries</i></b> by the
Malabar Superintendent of Police in his report on the 1921
rebellion. R.H. Hitchcock noted:<p>

          <blockquote>... many of them (Mappila activists] neither were nor ever
     would be tenants but were quite ready to fall in with any
     suggestions which promised a chance of looting the rich and
     for the same reason to support the <b><i>Khilafat</i></b> agitation as
     meaning Mappilla Raj in Ernad... (Hitchcock 1925:20)."</blockquote>

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 13]</b> <p>

     Hitchcock understood the rebellion primarily in religious
terms, and yet understood the significance of its anti-state
("Mappilla Raj" means Muslim rule) and anti-elite character.
"Looting the rich" captures the social banditry strand of the
Mappila uprisings.<a name="rf22"></a>
<a href="#n_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> His account stresses the transmission of
radicalism through organic religious intellectuals (though he
rails against their "ignorance") and the activities of the
Congress through its <b><i>Khilafat</i></b> mobilization and national
conferences -- linking poor Muslims in a backward district to
international movement of historic significance. He also
recognized the role of official repression of widespread banditry
(which had accompanied all Mappila outbursts) in triggering
rebellion.<a name="rf23"></a><a href="#n_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a><p>

     The Superintendent of Police also understood the role of
martyrdom and general destitution in generating radicalism:
   
          <blockquote>"It was the poorest who kept moving inland in search of a
     livelihood and their mosques could not afford to pay for
     proper instructors and they had to rely for instruction on
     self-styled Thangals and Mussaliars, often as ignorant as
     themselves, who preached and taught fanaticism and sometimes
     even practised it (Hitchcock 1925:17)." </blockquote><p>

     Hitchcock emphasized that rebels tended to be poor and young
and often without a livelihood; periods of "fanaticism" were
preceded and accompanied by a "general spirit of lawlessness" and
increased crime, from "petty house-breakings" to <b><i>dacoity</i></b> (ibid
15). From the earliest injunctions that to kill a landlord was
not only free from sin but a religious obligation, the Mappilas
had made clear that they perceived tenurial oppression to be a
legitimate trigger for violence, having repeatedly attempted
remedy through the state and failed.<p>

     The literature on the Mappila uprisings is so vast that the
account above can only scratch the surface. Conrad Wood concludes
that "as a challenge to British rule the Moplah outbreak was mere
ritual" (1978:151). Both Mappilas and colonial officials knew
that the insurgents would die. Though the desperate
confrontations of the Mappilas in the 19th century were rooted in
a cognitive frame in which martyrdom figured prominently, their
1921 rebellion was of a more political character. It might have
succeeded against a weaker state or wrung concessions from a less
repressive state. Moreover, deadly confrontations against long
odds continued in Kerala throughout the struggle for independence
and land. Radicalism in Kerala changed forms in the twentieth
century, but the themes of commemoration of martyrs
<a name="rf24"></a><a href="#n_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> and
struggle against immediately awesome odds continued to constitute
a distinctive mode of social challenge. Moral outrage congruent
with the Mappila charges sustained the movement even as tactical
wisdom and organization replaced suicide with mere danger.
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 12]</b> <p>

     The nineteenth century uprisings were far more extensive and
bloody than the more familiar Deccan Riots. They were, as
suggested by the title of K.N. Panikkar's superb book, "against
lord and state:" against lords whose novel powers of eviction and
wrack-renting were a product of the state just as agrarian
distress resulting from the state's policies undermined
bargaining power and made violence a last resort. They were, as
Logan perceived, defensive in character, as stressed in Polanyi's
view of reaction to the novel property forms of market society.
Whatever the ethnic composition of the tenantry, the notion that
land rights should be subject to market dynamics -- and the
subsequent dislocations of evictions and enhanced rents and
renewal fees (<b><i>michivaram</i></b>) -- was clearly at variance with the
existing moral economy of Malabar.<a name="rf25"></a>
<a href="#n_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a><p>

     The Mappila risings illustrate two points about the origins
of mobilization of agrarian underclasses for redress. First, in
line with social theory on the causes of agrarian protest, an
agrarian structure characterized by high levels of insecure
tenancy, extreme inequalities in land ownership, and the
resulting miserable terms of exchange between landed and landless
generated the structural potential for agrarian radicalism (cp
Zagoria 1971). Secondly, "defensive reactions" of elements of
society to dislocations engendered by a market acting on new
property rights drove extreme responses aimed at re-establishing
traditional security.<p>

     But as importantly, the Mappilla revolts illustrate the
importance of overlays of social oppression which may accompany
economic exploitation. The self-definition of Muslims as Muslims
provided the symbols and forms of organization without which
collective action is extremely difficult. Similar issues of
ethnic identification and mobilization were later to play an
important role in the growth of a radical and redistributive
coalition centered around the communists (Herring 1988). As
importantly, the futile jacqueries of the Muslim population, and
the proto-political rebellion of 1921, sensitized the state to
the necessity of responding to agrarian distress. To ignore that
threat was to risk rural authority and tax revenues, as
explicitly recognized in the 1940s.<p>

Back <a href="#top">to the top</a>.<p>

<b><a name="from">From Jacquerie to Sustained Militance</a></b><p>

     The Moplah Rebellion illuminated and attacked the structural
unity of landlordism and colonial rule. The colonial government
was quite explicit in its recognition of dependence on the landed
elite for continued hegemony (Sen 1955:55), and the landlords
reciprocally depended on the colonial state's machinery to quash
challenges to their local authority. Understanding this
structural unity is crucial for understanding the divergence in
support bases for Congress and communist programs: conservative
groups within the Congress came to oppose, with varying resolve 

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 15]</b>  

and militancy, one leg of the agrarian power structure -- colonial
rule -- but were unwilling to attack the other -- landlordism as a
social institution, much less the landed gentry as individuals.
Radicals within the nationalist movement, on the other hand, came
to oppose with increasing militancy both landlordism and the
colonial state; they perceived this linkage to be crucial for the
success on the independence struggle. A member of the Congress
left, and later communist leader, noted:<p>

          <blockquote>"Not only was the peasantry the most numerous section of the
     Indian people, but it was in the villages that imperialism
     had its most reliable ally -- the feudal landlords. The
     police thana functioning in close collaboration with the big
     landlords was the center of imperialism's oppressive
     machinery (Namboodiripad 1976:183)."</blockquote><p>

     The Moplah Rebellion, and later outbursts of peasant
militance, were denounced and abandoned by Gandhi and Congress
conservatives; the radicals supported, nurtured and organized
around these social impulses, with incrementally increasing,
though uneven, organizational development and tactical success.
The basis of organization was both caste and class. Though caste
and class correlated highly in this period, specific caste
indignities and privileges constituted grounds for collective
action. Importantly, whereas a class identity lacks any
primordial organic reality or organizational expression, castes
existed as functioning social organizations, and thus provided
nuclei for de facto multi-class mobilization of the poor.<p>

     Organized peasant movements in Malabar began with the
interests of superior tenants -- in a structural sense a middle-
peasantry. Agitations for the rights of kanam, tenants were
clearly intertwined with the struggles of Nairs as a caste
(though the extreme form of this argument, as made by Robin
Jeffrey, overstates the case<a name="rf26"></a>
<a href="#n_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>). Unlike the elite Namboodiri
Brahmins, Nairs took to English education and government service
early on and formed a caste association to knit together various
ritually distinct sub-castes to form a political force to demand
privileged treatment. As Nairs colonized lower levels of the
imperial machinery, they experienced acute status inconsistency.
E.M.S. Namboodiripad (1943:4) wrote depreciatingly about his own
caste (and indeed his own family) in describing the conflict
within the "new class of educated young men and officers" (eg
<b><i>tehsildars</i></b>, police inspectors, "sub-judges"):<p>

          <blockquote>"The very same state which made them politically independent
     of the Jenmis [landlords -- connoting Brahmins here] made
     them much more dependent economically on those same
     Jenmis... The educated and professional man with a wide
     outlook and sturdy sense of self-respect has to humiliate
     himself before the narrow-minded and conceited ignoramus who
     is his landlord."</blockquote><p>

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 16]</b> <p>

     Similar issues of social humiliation -- of outcaste
communities -- were employed in a movement which in economic
terms served the interests almost exclusively of the superior
tenants. Though recognizing the necessity of eventual abolition
of the "feudal" landlord-dominated agrarian system, leftists in
the Congress were careful in mobilizing to attack the injustices
explicitly felt by the peasantry, while linking these to social
indignities on which consciousness was well developed. on strict
economic issues, consciousness moved more slowly. For example, in
many villages, the legitimacy of rent and taxes was too deeply
imbedded to be attacked frontally; landlords were then attacked
for the social humiliation or abuse of "their" tenants or for
illegal exactions which denoted traditional obeisance. One jatha
(protest march) against a single landlord for such illegal
exactions attracted 7,000 peasants in Malabar in the mid-1930s
(Krishnan 1971:32). There were hundreds of similar protests on a
smaller scale (Gopalan 1973: Chapters 8, 9; Karat 1976). These
protests, held against almost all important jenmis of Malabar,
simultaneously raised the consciousness of similar objective
class position, generated self-confidence and helped overcome
traditional communal (religious), class and caste cleavages among
peasants, in the same manner that Jeffrey (1984) observes among
the working class in Kerala.<p>

     The Malabar Kudiyan Sangham (tenants' association) was
formed at Pattambi in 1920; the leadership was predominantly of
the Nair caste [and <b><i>kanakkar</i></b> class]. Clandestine activities
predominated in the early years ("because of the fear of the
tenants... 11), but over eight years of operation, the MKS formed
about one-hundred local units throughout Malabar (Radhakrishnan
1989: 78,79). Organization of landlords, which had begun with the
consideration of land reforms by the colonial administration in
the 1880s, was furthered by activities of the MKS and elections
to the Madras Legislative Council in 1923 (ibid. 79-81). Public
debates and memorials, letter-writing campaigns and agitations
were organized around the formulation of the Malabar Tenancy
Bill. One representative of the Mappila tenants explicitly
threatened another uprising if the government continued its
anti(tenant policy (ibid. 85). Though Radhakrishnan (1989:86)
argues that "the attitude of the government had undergone a
favorable change because ... the agitation was championed by the
educated middle class consisting of lawyers and government
servants ....," reverberations of the Mappila uprisings clearly
influenced policy as well.<p>

     The Malabar Tenancy Act (XIV of 1930) was a victory for
tenants and the MKS, but mainly for the superior tenants who
spearheaded it. Radhakrishnan gives the best summary of colonial
politics surrounding the law:<p>

          <blockquote>"Malabar is one of the few places in India where land
     relations were intensively and effectively articulated by an 
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 17]</b>  

          educated middle class as early as in the first quarter of
     this century. Though the British administration stood
     stolidly by the Janmis throughout nearly a century of
     agitations by the illiterate, impoverished, and inarticulate
     Mappilas, when the educated, affluent, and articulate Nayars
     appeared on the scene, in less than a decade it conceded to
     their demands as a matter of political expediency
     (1989:87-88)."</blockquote><p>

     Though true, this prospective needs qualification. First,
the colonial state was itself divided on the issue of tenancy
reform in response to the "Mappila outrages." Tenure reform first
emerged as an agenda for political management -- for rooting out
the social base of rebellion. Discussion of tenure reform in turn
prompted organization of landlords where none had existed before
and joined contesting classes in competition before the colonial
state through such fora as the colonial state allowed (both
political, as in the Madras Legislative Council, and public,
through memorials, newspaper debates and public meetings).
Finally, the articulateness of Nairs is perhaps less important
than success in capturing the support of the Congress
organizational wing (Jeffrey 1978), their instantiation in
crucial rungs of the state's machinery and official fears of
resurgence of agrarian rebellion. The colonial state really
rested on two pillars, the <b><i>janmis</i></b> whose control through
landlordism made them a necessary political ally, and the
educated middle class, largely overlapping with the Nair
community and <b><i>kanakkar</i></b> class, who carried the brunt of
administrative control to the villages.<p>

     Victory for the superior tenants in 1930 created new
marketable rights called "almost liquid gold" by Namboodiripad
(1943:12). Rent and renewal fees became predictable and security
of tenure largely assured, at least for the stronger of the
class. Nevertheless, the subinfeudation of Malabar ensured that
those below the <b><i>kanakkar</i></b> (about half the tenantry as well as the
"serf/slave" classes) would have to fight new struggles to
receive comparable benefits. The politics of ratchets gave these
classes a model and political niche to pursue those struggles.<p>

     The organizational culmination of well-organized local
protests was the formation of the Kerala Karshaka Sangham
(peasant association), beginning in Malabar at the sub-district
level in 1935. The district-level Malabar Sangham was formed the
following year (Paulini 1978:160). organizationally, the All
Malabar Karshaka Sangham (peasant association) consisted of three
tiers, with a village <b><i>sangham</i></b> at the bottom, an intermediary
<b><i>taluk</i></b> association and district-level association at the top. The
activists of the Congress patiently organized, village by
village, building in each one a volunteer defense committee, and
establishing study groups and reading rooms. Leading Congress
socialists wrote plays with radical content; dramatic
presentations were important in mobilization.<a name="rf27">
</a><a href="#n_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 18]</b> <p>

     These organizational efforts were aided by the enormous
respect for learning, and relatively high literacy rate, of
Kerala. The newspaper <b><i>Kudiyan</i></b> 
(Tenant) was founded in Malabar in
1922 (Radhakrishnan 1989:78). School teachers and students were
important as local leaders and activists. The great peasant
leader, A.K. Gopalan, began his professional life as a village
teacher.<a name="rf28"></a>
<a href="#n_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a> Communist 
Party elder E.M.S. Namboodiripad (1968:156)
gives perhaps the best summary of the fusion of mobilizing agents
and issues:<p>

     <blockquote>"It is the combination in one person of the office bearer of
     the Village Congress Committee, the leader of the Teachers'
     Union, and the organizer of the Kisan Sangham. [peasant
     association] that made the anti-imperialist movement strike
     deep roots in the countryside."</blockquote><p>

     Mobilization of the peasantry was, however, a major source
of cleavage within the Congress. Radhakrishnan dates the first
organized efforts to protect kanam tenants from 1912; competition
within the Malabar Congress shifted the balance of power from
<b><i>janmis</i></b> to tenant leaders between 1916 and 1920 (1989:77). The
open split occurred in 1920 when a group of landlords and
professionals led by Annie Besant, representing conservatives in
the Malabar Congress, walked out when outvoted on both tenancy
reform and organizational militance (cf. Hart and Herring 1977:
200). The conservative Congress leadership, locally and
nationally, had deep reservations about militant peasant
movements under the aegis of the Congress. Leftists had no such
reservations, and built a powerful peasant movement around issues
of economic exploitation and social indignities, linked
organizationally to the nationalist movement and to the
burgeoning trade union movement. Their success contrasts sharply
with efforts in many other parts of the subcontinent and provided
a solid political base for the eventual emergence of the
Communist Party.<p></td></tr></table></center>

     Leadership on the left has attributed organizational success
to intertwined factors of generalized rural misery (exacerbated
in the 1930s by the great Depression, magnified by Kerala's
extensive integration into international markets) and
imperialism, which were structurally linked. Ramifications of the

<a name="rf31"></a><a href="#n_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a><p>

     The dual mobilizing targets remained state and landlords,
but social conditions in general were linked to these two
institutions. Social oppression was attacked symbolically through
large inter-caste dinners and programmatically through demands
for temple entry and access to government jobs and education.
Social oppression and decadence were presented as symptomatic of
the decaying social system of oppressive landlordism.<p>

     Leaders of the peasant mobilization are quite clear on the
issue of consciousness. The Mappila rebels had lacked a clear
consciousness of class; landlords were perceived in more
individual than class terms in local assaults. Activist
propaganda and tactics built on this tradition even while linking
general misery to systemic causes. Specific Janmis were attacked
as "the embodiment of all evils," especially when associated with
a "reprehensible life style" (Oommen 1985:46), increasingly
associated with the class as a whole. Landlords were portrayed in
propaganda and popular theater generically as decadent and
rapacious parasites, a perception buttressed by the presence of
caste reformers from the janmi station among Congress
radicals.<p>

     If the Mappila rebellions were clearly "against lord and
state," so too were the subsequent mobilizations buttressed by
the concrete fusions between colonial state and property claims.
Both government and landlord land lying fallow was forcibly
occupied and tilled. The failure of official channels to cope
with famine in 1942-43 led to confiscation of grain at locally
determined fair prices and distribution through peoples'
committees. Black market sales of rice were collectively opposed.
Government sales of forest land in Malabar to capitalists (often
from Travancore) were militantly opposed because of the
restrictions subsequently placed on traditional rights to gather
green manure and wood. More important for future politics,
responsibility for agricultural development was placed squarely
on the state; failure to dewater or irrigate potentially
cultivable land, distribute fertilizers, provide credit for land
clearing and cultivation or assure food distribution were the
occasions for mass meetings, protest marches and direct action,
often leading to official violence, death and imprisonment.

     Repression creates martyrs. Opposition to landlords evoked
retaliation in the form of evictions, harassment through the
police and courts (through false cases supported by the
landlord's loyal dependents), social boycott and physical
coercion (Oommen 1985:48). Just as the Mappilas were memorialized
by the naming of mosques after martyrs (eg Logan 1887:648),

martyrs in the later struggles against lord and state were
memorialized in song and care for their families. Young E.K.
Nayanar (recently Chief Minister of Kerala) recalls that one of
his early exposures to leftist discussions and literature was in
a reading room organized by the Congress left and named for Sri
Harshan, a Harijan who died in the Cannanore jail (Nayanar
1982:8). The Kayoor martyrs (1943) were memorialized not only in
legend and song (eg Niranjana 1977), but through celebration of
March 29, the date of their death, as All-India Kisan [peasant]
Day. The All-India Kisan Sabha organized relief for their
families; British trade unionists raised the then princely sum of
Rs 61600 for the effort as well.<a name="rf33"></a>

     The movement's moral economy in this period of mobilization
had moved beyond security of tenure, which was partly met in the
1930 legislation. As early as 1935, the slogan of "death to
landlordism" had joined demands for representative rule and
extension of security of tenure downwards in the class structure.
Clearly the party needed to retain the interests of kanam tenants
as it extended the movement down the social and tenurial
structure. At the Chirakkal Taluk Peasants' Conference in
November of 1936, it was resolved that landlords were entitled
not to rent, but to the residual: that portion of gross produce
(if any) left after the subsistence needs of peasants had been
met. As interim measures, the conference demanded rental limits
at one-fourth of the gross produce, abolition of extra-rental
payment obligations (<b><i>kazhcha</i></b>, 
<b><i>kankani</i></b>, <b><i>seelakkasu</i></b>, etc),
cancellation of arrears of rent, security of tenure, price
supports for agricultural commodities and fixation of wages for
agricultural laborers.<a name="rf34"></a>
<a href="#n_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a><p>

     The open split which created the communist party was
presaged by failure of the Congress to move on these measures.
The Congress Party, which was then the umbrella under which
radical rural organizations operated, won the elections of 1937
and formed a ministry in Madras. When the government failed to
take even the limited remedial measures within its power, peasant
organizations launched a movement against both landlords and the
pro-landlord government. As usual the tactics included social
boycott and <b><i>jathas</i></b> to 
the homes of prominent and especially
obnoxious landlords (Radhakrishnan 1989:96). British concern with
the social boycott (eg by barbers, washermen, etc.) was two-fold:
that a "law and order situation" could result and that the
withholding of rent could jeopardize the fiscal imperative which
was the center of colonial rule. A dispatch from a confidential
report to the Home Ministry in Madras noted in 1938:<p>

          <blockquote>"The District Magistrate of Malabar reports that a no-rent
     campaign ... which has been carried on for some time... is
     achieving considerable success, and that in the absence of
     any organized opposition is in some parts undermining the
     authority of Government. He fears that, if the jenmies are

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 21]</b> 

          unable to collect their rents, it will have a serious effect
     on the land revenue collections... (ibid)."</blockquote><p>

     The alliance between superior and inferior tenants began to
show strains during the debates on amendments to the Malabar
Tenancy Act (Radhakrishnan 1989:99). Maintenance of the coalition
was aided by agreement to focus agitations on the refusal of the
Congress Government of Madras to reduce statutory rents and to
waive the advance deposit of one year's rent in the case of
<b><i>verumpattakar</i></b> (inferior tenants).<p>

     Communist theoretician E.M.S. Namboodiripad raised in his
dissenting opinion to the report of the committee the question of
whether or not landlordism serves "any useful social function" or
is rather "parasitic." Namboodiripad later (1954:19-20) explained
his conclusion that landlordism was parasitic under modern
conditions because of the withering of traditional landlord
functions: "In mediaeval days, landlordism was a social,
political and cultural institution, as well as economic. But
shorn of all these functions, the Malabar <b><i>janmis</i></b> today are only
dead corpses of their own forefathers." The vast sum collected by
landlords was calculated by E.M.S. Namboodiripad (1943:19-20). He
argued in social contractual terms that if vast payment were
matched by performance of services (specifically analogous to the
entrepreneur of industry, including advancing of working capital,
construction of irrigation works, research into scientific
agriculture, etc.), it would be justified. Since dead corpses "as
a class" had ceased to perform traditional functions, and had
taken up no modern ones, the institution of landlordism could not
withstand scrutiny.<p>

     Focus on the aggregate rent collected by landlords created
the coalition-building notion of a "rent fund" (cf Wolf 1966)
concretely. The move to abolish landlords <b><i>as a class</i></b>, whether
decadent or not, was a tactical ratchet which permitted the party
to promise that distribution of a rent fund would satisfy the
disparate claimants (whose class positions were objectively
opposed to one another) in the coalition.<a name="rf35"></a>
<a href="#n_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a><p>

     Independence did not change a great deal for those at the
bottom of the agrarian structure. Demonstrations on the issue of
food availability and pricing, as well as militant intervention
in food distribution continued. Slogans escalated to reflect the
Calcutta thesis of the communist party ("land to the tiller and
power to the people"), given overtones of genuine revolution by
reflections of the armed struggle with the Government of India in
Telengana ("Telengana way, our way") .
<a name="rf36"></a><a href="#n_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a> 
Unemployment and near-
famine conditions continued to produce militant confrontations,
deaths and martyrs. The Munayan Kunnu incident in north Malabar
in April of 1948 was held by Malabar activists to have the "same
place in Kerala politics as that of Vayalar [in Travancore]"
(Nayanar 1982:80), though with much less loss of life.
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 22]</b> <p>
<p>

     After a period under ban during the "left adventurist"
(armed insurrectionary) period of early Independence, the
Communist party emerged again in a constitutional role in the
early 1950s; the peasant movement "rose up from its own ashes"
(Nayanar 1982:81). Unity with peasant organizations of the
Congress and the Indian Socialist Party (Kisan Congress and Kisan
Panchayat respectively) were attempted but failed.
<a name="rf37"></a><a href="#n_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a> The party's
Malabar wing gained great prestige in hosting the Eleventh
All-India Kisan Sammelan in Malabar in 1953. The conference site
was significantly named "Kayyoor Nagar (city)" in memory of the
Kayoor martyrs (ibid:82).<p>

     Until its final amendment in 1954, the Malabar Tenancy Act
remained the centerpiece of struggles specifically focused on
land. The 1951 amendment prompted more of the agitations and
petitions which had begun around the turn of the century.
Significantly, the 1954 Amendment granted most of the minimalist
claims of the tenantry (falling short of "death to landlordism"),
including new fair rent provisions, strengthening protections
from evictions, and abolishing the payment-in-advance provisions
for <b><i>verumpattakar</i></b>.<a name="rf38"></a>
<a href="#n_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a> 
The rent fund remained in the hands of
landlords, though reduced in size (de jure) and with fewer levers
available to ensure control of tenants. What remained was the
final abolition of landlordism altogether.<p>

<b><a name="broa">Broader Social Ecology and Political Structure</a></b><p>

     Features of the broader societal structure proved as
important as narrowly agrarian structure in generating a leftist
coalition. Political structure divided space in ways which
permitted both learning across sub-political systems and
mobilization of the left on issues of linguistic nationalism
after independence. Economic structure facilitated both the
emergence of a genuine worker-peasant alliance under communist
leadership and intensification of commercialization forces which
were present throughout the subcontinent in variable force.<p>

     Kerala was integrated into international trading networks at
a very early date. Indeed, the Roman Empire worried about its
terms of trade with the region. Trade wars among Arab forces and
European companies extended commercial penetration from the
sixteenth century. The extensive connection to international
trade (coir, rubber, cardamom, pepper, ginger, etc.) was
especially apparent in the depression of the 1930's, which
produced severe dislocations and furthered leftist mobilization
in Kerala (e.g. Paulini 1978:195; Kannan 1988:81-87; Menon 1994:
25-26, passim). From 1931 onwards, landless or virtually landless
agricultural laborers increased dramatically both in absolute
terms and as a percentage of agriculturalists (Raj and Tharakan
1983:35), concretely linking the non-agricultural distress to
pressure on the agrarian structure.  
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 23]</b> <p>

Early and penetrating commercialization was coupled with a
settlement pattern which differentiates Kerala from much of
India; rather than discrete villages of the modal sort, Kerala
presents a continuous gradient of urban to peri-urban to rural
communities. The agrarian poor often had one foot in economic
activities associated with trade, simple agro-industrial
processing (coir (coconut fiber] is archetypal), and small-scale
industrial activities. The familiar leftist exhortation to form a
"worker-peasant alliance" was achieved in part by the very
structure of settlement patterns, physical ecology, economic
activity and occupations (Herring 1996: Ch 2).<p>

     In contrast to Malabar, organized peasant revolts were
largely absent in the princely states of Travancore and Cochin;
T.K. Oommen correctly characterizes the major uprisings (the
Kundara Declaration of Velu Thampi [1810-1819] and the Malayalee
Memorial of 1891) as anti-imperialist struggles in which peasants
participated, though their specific demands as peasants were not
primary (1985:54). Travancore led the way in tenurial reforms,
essentially as a part of the struggle to establish royal
authority over local chiefs and stimulate commercial development.
New regulations beginning in 1818 promoted recovery of "waste"
lands for commercial crops. Pro-tenant regulations began in 1829
and were strengthened (de jure) in episodes of reforms which
ratcheted down the tenurial ladder, beginning of course with the
relatively powerful <b><i>kanakkar</i></b>. 
Land was concentrated under royal
control and tenants in effect became tenants of the state, with
permanent occupancy rights and low rents. Ownership of these
lands was conferred on tenants of state lands in 1865, laying the
base for what is usually considered a "peasant-proprietor"
system, in stark contrast to that of Malabar.
<a name="rf39"></a><a href="#n_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>  
In line with
academic theory of the productivity consequences of tenurial
systems, the government hoped through this arrangement to promote
commercial agriculture, and did so effectively (Varghese
1970).<p>

     The land reforms of nineteenth-century Travancore were top-
down, not a response to peasantist pressures, but rather an
exercise in state formation and creation of property rights
conducive to commercial development. Likewise, slavery was
abolished in 1855 in Travancore, though most agricultural
laborers continued to be attached to landowners in a "semi-slave
status" (Oommen 1985:55). As the site of intensive
commercialization and early capitalist development, Travancore
witnessed extraordinary social mobility (both up and down) which
disrupted the traditional caste occupational structure and
intensified the process of proletarianization (Kannan 1988:
38-88).<p>

     Like Travancore, regulations in Cochin (Kochi) offered
nominal protection for the upper stratum of tenants in the
nineteenth century, though with minimal implementation. T.K.
Oommen (1985:58) argues that these minimal protections help
explain the

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 24]</b> 

relatively quiescent state of agrarian relations in Cochin (as in
Travancore). To this explanation must be added one of relative
economic opportunity, particularly in Travancore, as new
commercial development of lands claimed by the state provided
outlets for surplus mercantile capital and some employment for
labor. Moreover, the extraordinary outbreak of evictions noted in
Malabar was muted in the southern regions. Certainly landlordism
as a social system was neither so dominant nor oppressive as in
Malabar.<p>

     Reforms in indirectly ruled Travancore and Cochin gave
impetus to popular opposition to the lagging response of the
colonial state in Malabar. This spread effect was fortified by
the activities of the Congress, which connected Malabar activists
not only with their counterparts in other Malayalam speaking
areas, but with those of all-Indian perspective and experience.
Finally, and most important for mobilization on the left,
protections in the southern regions were poorly enforced,
creating the need for popular militance to enforce nominal
benefits. Such protections also did not reach down the tenurial
and social ladder; land to the tiller remained an attractive
mobilizing force. Finally, limited reforms did not prevent
increased proletarianization over time, nor general
immiserization during periodic crises (most notably the
depression of the 1930s). Rural radicalism in Travancore and
Cochin was in any event more integrated with working class
militance and anti-authoritarian demands for popular rule
(Herring 1996: Ch 2).<p>

     Political structure mattered fundamentally after
Independence. Many of the dynamics described above -- leftist
success in an exploitative agrarian structure -- were present in
Thanjavur (Tanjore) district as well (Bouton 1985). Under
colonial rule, Malabar was but one district of the Madras
Presidency, distant from the capital in Madras, and from
Thanjavur. Malabar was easy for the Presidency to ignore. After
Independence, Malabar was joined to Kerala State, uniting left
movements over the entire area in which Malayalam is spoken and
adding a more militant agrarian base to Kerala's populace.
Thanjavur remained an isolated outpost of agrarian radicalism in
the State of Tamilnadu. This conjunctural reorganization of
political space explains much of the success of radical
mobilization in Kerala and its failure in neighboring
Tamilnadu.<p>

<b><a name="left">Left and Right on the Agrarian Question</a></b><p>

     Differences in ability to address expressed grievances and
organize around radical programs are rooted in both the social
theories and social bases of the contending groups which later
became the Congress Party and the Communist Party which emerged
from its umbrella. In Kerala, the split between radicals and
conservatives in the Congress movement began early and was
expressed in continuing struggles for control of the
organization 

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 25]</b> 

and its tactics. The Moplah rebels were branded indelibly with
the mark of violence and class conflict, tactics repeatedly
disavowed by All-India Congress leadership and by Mahatma Gandhi
in particular. Moreover, the Congress connection with local
notables rendered an alliance with peasant radicalism impossible
practically. Gandhi's theory of exploitation was palatable, if
not universally acceptable, to landed elites: landlordism <b><i>as
usually practiced</i></b> was indeed exploitative, Gandhi argued, not
from any "inherent necessity," but rather because of the moral
defects of certain landlords (defects which were corrigible
through suasion and enlightenment). Gandhi's theory of
"trusteeship" explicitly allowed for maintenance of traditional
class divisions and privileges, though optimally with reforms in
the moral economy of the overlords.<a name="rf40"></a>
<a href="#n_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a><p>

     Gandhi himself recognized that the Congress represented "no
immediate menace" to wealthy merchants, landlords, and
industrialists (Thorner 1980:47). Indeed, given the colonial
state's periodic attempts to reform agrarian relations, some
landlords found it advantageous to keep a hand in politically
through the Congress (McLane 1978:211).<p>

     Tactically and philosophically, the Indian National Congress
was not a revolutionary movement, but rather a reformist and
anti-colonial one. In the developing leftist analysis, the abuses
of landlordism were not simply manifestations of aberrant,
morally-deficient landowners. Rather, landlordism was perceived
in structural, systemic terms: a social system sustained by
colonial rule and ultimately guaranteed by force. In this
analysis, landlordism was a multi-faceted institution
inextricably intertwined with caste indignities (which were more
severe and extreme in Kerala than elsewhere), economic
exploitation, political inequality and imperialism: a social
system which tenure reform alone could not dissolve.
<a name="rf41"></a><a href="#n_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a><p>

     The leftists did use land-tenure reform (security of use-
rights and rental controls) as a mobilizing issue, but not as end
in itself; rather, they employed a continuous ratchet-effect
strategy. As the colonial government made minimal concessions
(such as the Malabar Tenancy Act of 1930), leftists mobilized for
extension of the concessions to lower layers of the peasantry and
simultaneously organized both for effective implementation of the
limited relief provisions and against the multifaceted social
manifestations of landlordism (Radhakrishnan 1980; Koshy
1976:110-16).<p>

     The combination of economic exploitation and social
oppressionof the agrarian underclasses arguably produced unique
conditions for the revolutionary force born of what Barrington
Moore, Jr. has termed "moral outrage." The outrage was generated
not only by the continuing presence of debt-bondage, slavery, and
serfdom at the very bottom and by deterioration of traditional 

<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 26]</b> 

security and economic rights of middle sectors, exacerbated by
the world depression of the 1930s, but also by the extreme
manifestations of non-economic inequality. Peasants of the lower
orders were degraded and humiliated by such practices as
"untouchability," which prevented certain groups from using
public roads, entering temples, approaching "clean caste"
members, covering certain parts of their bodies with clothing,
using certain water supplies, etc. The rural poor were subjected
to severe oppression such as sexual exploitation of women and
brutal beatings, as well as to petty significations of inferior
status, such as not being allowed to wear shoes or long wraps
(<b><i>lungis</i></b>).<a name="rf42"></a>
<a href="#n_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a><p>

     Solutions proposed by the Congress to the social indignities
of the depressed castes/classes did not address the experience of
multi-faceted exploitation and sometimes boomeranged. Communist
leader E.K. Nayanar recounted a formative experience from his
youth active in the Congress movement. Congress workers promoting
the liquor-prohibition movement asked an elderly peasant not to
take a drink. He responded:<p>

          <blockquote>"You sons of rich landlords need no liquor. Those like me
     who work hard from morning to evening do need it. Only then
     can we prepare ourselves for work the next day. What we earn
     by such hard work, you drain from us as rent and other
     payments... Even after this perpetual hard work we are poor.
     our only enjoyment is toddy. Won't you let us enjoy this
     humble refreshment? We don't want your Congress. Will you
     let us draw drinking water from your wells. No... You will
     not let us live on this earth (Nayanar 1982:7)."</blockquote><p>

     Nayanar's experience with the Congress prohibition campaign
is symptomatic of the confrontations of leftists with the
Congress in several ways. Reformist agitations not only brought
him into contact with peasants as individuals, but exposed
hypocrisy within the reformist movement: "Many who joined us to
picket the [toddy] shops would have liquor brought to them in the
evening and drink. This nauseated me. I hated these hypocrites
(Nayanar 1982:8)." Even those who hated the communists
acknowledged their sincerity, self-denial and personal integrity
-- all values central to the Congress movement ideologically.
Leftist leaders acknowledge the extraordinary impact of Gandhi
and the Gandhians in introducing new forms of public protest and
legitimating idealism, generating enthusiasm and nurturing
activism in Malabar. What limited their support for the Gandhian
position was the limits placed on the scope of organization,
tactics and substantive issues important to the people with whom
they were encouraged to work.<p>

     Linkages to a national anti-colonial movement thus aided
enormously in the leftist mobilization-The umbrella Congress
provided organizational structures and mass energy. Yet its 
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 27]</b> 

refusal to allow those energies to develop independently of
movement elites and their particular ideology provided a
mobilizational niche for a party to its left, analogous to the
structural niche opened by colonial land policy effecting the
"great transformation."<p>

Back <a href="#top">to the top</a>.<p>

<b><a name="radi">Radical Strategy, Ratchet Tactics</a></b><p>

     Sustaining the agrarian coalition -- divided by community,
class, individual interests and objectives (e.g. Menon 1994) -- 
necessitated tactical wisdom. Land reform was central to the
solution of collective action problems among "the peasantry" of
Kerala historically.<p>

     Jawaharlal Nehru termed the land question the central issue
in building a democratic and progressive republic capable of
economic growth. Because the Indian Constitution is federal, and
allocates to the states responsibility for land reform, the
directives of the Congress-dominated Centre (Delhi) during its
flirtation with land reform have been only imperfectly, if at
all, translated into law by Congress-dominated State governments.
For at least three decades after Independence, there was
persistent hand-wringing in Delhi over the failure of
conservative State-level elites affiliated with the Congress to
translate proclaimed policy into results on the ground; part of
this concern, explicitly articulated by Indira Gandhi, is that
the failure of land reforms, and the consequent increasing
disparities in life chances in rural India, produces political
instability and the opportunity for radical parties to mobilize
the rural poor (Herring 1983:4-8;125-152). In Kerala, Indira
Gandhi's fears are born out by history, reaching back to the
early concerns of William Logan as a colonial officer on the
periphery.<p>

     Bhabani Sen Gupta has argued that "land relationships happen
to be the strongest determinant in political alignments at the
state level" (1972:290). Though controversial, this statement
captures the core of the historical development of a powerful
communist movement in Kerala. Clearly there were other issues
(see Nossiter 1981 for an encyclopedic cataloging), but questions
of forms of landed property and its relation to market forces
generated the organizational base without which communist
electoral power would have been impossible. That the land issue
was central is buttressed by the astounding electoral performance
of the communists after their first ministry was dismissed by
Delhi, when issues of colonialism were long passed (Herring 1983:
Chapter 6).<p>

     But promising and delivering land reform are no mean tasks.
There are always too many claimants, rooted in powerful claims of
moral economy. "Peasants" have both other interests and
competitive relations to one another. 
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 28]</b> <p>

     Tactics on the left thus necessitated a combination of
ratchet and inclusionary elements; for those protected by popular
struggles won (eg the kanakkar), the movement then offered the
means to benefit from mere legislative victories. T.K. Oommen
(1985:56-57) notes that the legal victories of tenants in
Travancore and Cochin were frequently rendered infructuous by
"the class character of the State bureaucracy -- particularly the
revenue administration and judiciary..." which remained elitist
and could subvert implementation in the absence of "any militant
and conscious peasant movement." Subversion of minimal
legislative remedy was even more evident in Malabar. Ratchet
tactics recognize that full protection of <b><i>de jure</i></b> gains, even
limited gains, required continuous mobilization to expand the
weight of society against the local state and elites to create
secure rights. In a capitalist society, such rights come with
ownership. Hence the escalation to "land to the tiller" -- the
final affirmation of rights of tenants via transformation through
complex intermediary stages to fee simple property. An interest
in politics of the left was thus created for tenants regardless
of the despotic benevolence of Travancore and (to a lesser
extent) Cochin. The failure of markets to provide meaningful
subsistence alternatives for the bottom of those societies
provided impetus for a radicalization over time similar to that
of Malabar.<a name="rf43"></a>
<a href="#n_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a><p>

     Limited rights thus continued the identification of
objective interests of tenants with the left so long as the
coalition did not address redistribution of the profits of
agriculturalists. This potential cleavage was covered by the
movement from redistributive issues against landlords to
redistributive issues defined in opposition to the state. But if
ratchets gave additional security and retained incentives for the
tenantry to stay with the left, expansion gave incentives for
lower social classes to join the struggle: the unemployed, the
socially despised, the landless. Their interests in objective
economic restructuring were paralleled by a cultural interest in
abolishing the disabilities and indignities imposed by economic
and social superiors.<p>

     Ratchet and inclusionary/expansionary politics focused on
the disentangling of land as a "bundle of rights" (Baden-Powell
1892). Colonial land policy had collapsed the bundle and
concentrated rights in a simple commodity called land, which
could be owned and subjected to market principles like any other
factor of production. Yet the specific strands of that bundle -- to
evict tenants, to prevent collection of forest materials, to
hoard the land's product, to brutalize labor -- were disputed in
the traditional moral economy and hence provided grounds for
mobilization through interpretation as exploitation.<p>

     Uncultivated land stands as a metaphor for ratchet politics
in general; both government and landlord fallows were militantly
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 29]</b> 

encroached by the landless. State and landlord were not only
structurally and functionally interdependent, as the Mappilas
recognized, but the moral economy of both coincided to
delegitimize the claims of the landless. There was not a great
deal of difference between colonial and independent state on this
score. The left gained from this issue by preventing a rupture in
their coalition; rather than facing the divisive issue of who
would benefit from track one reforms (targeted, legalistic,
electoral), the left instead linked general economic disaster to
visible symbols (after all, the Namboodiris named <b><i>themselves</i></b> 
"gods on earth") and restitution to distributive issues outside
the coalition. Without lord and (colonial) state there would be
land and wages to go around, as in the mythic times of the rule
of Mahabeli.<p>

     Agrarian rejection of the great transformation wrought by
British policy in Malabar varied in form, but contributed to
creation of a broad social movement characterized by radicalism.
The Mappila uprisings -- "not mere riots or affrays, but
murderous outrages, such as have no parallel in any other parts
of Her Majesty's dominions" (Wood 1987:132) -- were ultimately
suicidal, but taught both the colonial state and peasant leaders
lessons. Though tenurial grievances figured in the Mappila's
outrage (as the state rejected petitions for redress and
landlords joined the state as targets of attack), the
participants were a collection of flotsam and jetsam cast off by
a society undergoing profound change, reflecting neither a
coherent class position nor a political program. Yet subsequent
movements built on the core of outrage and tactics established by
the Mappilas -- from targeting of the most reprehensible
landlords to memorialization of martyrs.<p>

     The subsequent progression of the Malabar peasantry's
organizational and programmatic struggle from <b><i>jacquerie</i></b> to
electoral power is encapsulated in the transition of titles of
the first newspaper of the movement founded in the 1920s:
Kudiyan, meaning "tenant," gave way to <b><i>Krishikaran</i></b>, meaning
"farmer" or "agriculturalist," launched in 1952. The specifically
"tenant" origins of the movement had expanded to debt relief,
government aid to agriculture, traditional commons rights for
gathering fuel and timber, rural unemployment, control of food
prices and black marketeering and a host of subsidiary issues.
The radical content of "land to the tiller and power to the
people" was paralleled by a more conservative ratchet politics,
in which concessions wrung from the government are expanded both
to make meaningful the previous concessions granted and to extend
the agitation to a broader base. Expansion of the social base and
retention of those for whom the ratchet had worked necessitated
expansion of issues.<p>

     Thus the Malabar Tenancy Act of 1930 was a measure for
"superior tenants" (<b><i>kannakar</i></b>), but realization of its benefits
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 30]</b> 

required measures of debt relief, taxation limits, and social
curbs on the real power of landlords on the ground.
Simultaneously, agitations for amendments to the Act created new
collective interests (those of <b><i>verumpattakar</i></b>) while retaining a
core of previous beneficiaries -- whose <i>de facto</i> benefits
depended on continued mobilization of local countervailing power.
As slogans radicalized, most clearly in the very first years of
Independence, the promise to strata below the tenants was more
implied and general than specific: abolition of landlordism or
landlord fallow would provide new lands even as attacks on
hoarders and black marketeers promised that a moral economy other
than the market would govern distribution. The bloody uprising at
Punnapra-Vayalar was neither tenant-led nor based, but rather a
broad attack on colonial state and market-driven determinations
of want and privilege.<p>

     By the 1950's, revolution had receded to a rhetorical
flourish superimposed on electoral politics rooted in tactical
support from the agrarian poor, working class and radical
intelligentsia (Sathyamurthy 1985). The legacies of agrarian
mobilization prior to and immediately following the first
communist electoral victory in 1957 are both social and
ideological. To an extent unmatched in the rest of the
subcontinent, political elites learned that agrarian grievances
must be answered; the rural poor would not accept inaction or
retrenchment of hard-won rights. Parties of the right learned the
value of rural mobilization and of at least symbolic commitment
to redistribution. Perhaps the most extraordinary feature of
debates on land reform in the Legislative Assembly in the 1960s
and 1970s was the consensus that appearing to be on the side of reform
was a political asset, not a liability (Herring 1983: Chapter 7).
Political parties across the ideological spectrum followed the
communists in establishing first peasant associations and then
agricultural workers unions (Herring 1989).<p>

     The material consequences were primarily organizational; the
left in rural Kerala became a real social force in the political
morphology. The cultural effects of this force were that the very
bottom of society began to believe that in combination, and with
sufficient militancy, they could exercise power, both defensively and
progressively. Later generations of politicians attempted to answer
the rural underclasses with a shift from the agrarian question to
agricultural development, from redistribution to distribution, from
moral economy to growth, but understood that they could not be
ignored.<p>

<b><a name="coll">Collective Action of "the Peasantry"</a></b><p>

Agrarian mobilization of such duration and persistent strength
presents a nested problem of collective action. There is no such
thing as the "peasantry" of organicist social theory.
<a name="rf44"></a><a href="#n_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a> The peasantry
is not only class-stratified, but composed of
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 31]</b> 

individuals with multiple identifications, all of which are
potentially (and empirically) important for political action. For
mobilization to succeed, individuals must determine in large numbers
that identification of interests as "peasants" overrides, at least
temporarily, class interests which are contradictory; that these
aggregate identifications of interest will be primary in regard to
political action; that sufficient others will so identify; that some
specific presentation of collective interests is consonant with
identified interests; and that the extraordinary risks of
confrontation should be born.<p>

     Failure to win periodic victories threatens disintegration of
the collective project; winning victories threatens withdrawal of
winners. A structural feature of landlordism   the massive "rent
fund" collected by landlords as a class -- provided a mechanism to
facilitate collective action in face-to-face communities. First,
abolition and redistribution of the rent fund offered selective
incentives to inferior tenants and laborers whose objective interests
were in conflict with those of the superior tenants. Secondly, the
rent fund presupposed and symbolically stood for landlordism as a
social system; targeting of multidimensionally egregious behavior of
landlords knit together stratified layers of the unprivileged. These
efforts at collective action cannot be understood absent the
historical conjunctures which drove them -- the great depression and
colonial rule in particular -- or the political project of the
insurgent Congress leftists who turned communists (Herring 1996: Ch
2).<p>

     Solution of the collective action problem for the peasantry
thus required both long-standing structural fact -- the "rent fund"
-- and the conjunctural evolution of a political party rooted
organically in the villages with both appropriate theory and tactical
space. Consider the contrast to villagers of Malaysia as described by
James Scott (1985). One important reason for resort to "weapons of
the weak" is the absence of a political party which put land reform
forward as a credible political project (1985: 81, passim). Tenants
and landless workers in Sedaka desired land reform, but would have
been foolish to believe either of the two political parties would
pursue it even if they promised it.<a name="rf45"></a>
<a href="#n_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a><p>

     Redistribution of land rights is one prominent strand of the
argument that peasant mobilization depends on selective incentives in
the rational-choice tradition (Lichbach 1994). But that perspective
naively assumes that political entrepreneurs are free to choose
maximizing strategies with no reference to their social base or
(consequent) credibility. Here Popkin's view of political
entrepreneurs is decidedly superior (1979: Chapter 6): credible
proposals that have some probability of solving the assurance problem
derive from demonstrated political wisdom, derived from practice and
bolstered by resonance with cultural 
<b>[</b><i>Herring - Mobilization</i> <b>++Page 32]</b> 

norms of integrity.<p>

     The ratchet and inclusionary tactics of the left came undone
with the final abolition of landlordism in the 1970s; it became
apparent that future redistribution of land was tactically impossible
and that the landless could be answered only at the cost of
alienation of their former (and dominant) allies -holders of landed
rights. The agrarian culmination of these alliances came in the form
of separate legislative enactments for tenants (abolition of
landlordism) and for the numerically dominant class of laborers (the
remarkable Agricultural Workers Act granting permanency of employment
and other anomalous benefits). <a name="rf46"></a>
<a href="#n_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>  The land reforms thus created a new
structure of interests and thus a new form of agrarian politics:
Marshallian dilemmas for the left and a stalemated class conflict on
the ground (cf Herring 1989). Whether cr not new solutions to the
collective action problem in the form of pie-expansion social
democracy will determine the future of the left and the fate of the
economy (cf Heller 1995).<p>

     If there is a lesson here for theories of collective action, it
is that parsimony may not be an unalloyed good. The long experience
of peasant mobilization in Kerala depended not only on central facets
of agrarian structure -- which is historically given and not easily
reducible to choice in any endogenous way -- but on broader social
ecology and political structure as well. Solution to the collective
action problem could not rely on selective incentives, but did depend
on organic political theory derived from praxis. "Moral outrage" was
as important as material interest in motivating powerless people to
face a repressive social order in rational expectation of deprivation
or worse. Choice presupposes structure; structure in turn depends for
its effect on a double cognitive filter -- what is right, what will
work -- which has an irreducibly contextual element. The
nomothetic quest of social science is best leavened by a language
of conjuncture and context.<p>

As will become apparent in the text, "nationalism" was in effect anti-imperialism, or more specifically, a
complex of moral outrage against specific connections between the colonial state and individual
life-chances. Agitations against the colonial state continued in form after independence, precisely because
the local experience of state intrusion, repression and intransigence continued to generate anger and niches
for organization. Subnationalism was a source of communist success, potentiated by the niche provided by
the peculiar organization of political space which was a residue of colonial rule.

Use of the European concept of feudalism is always problematic in the Indic context. "Feudalism" in
political rhetoric, planning documents of the first two decades of independence, and many academic
treatments simply means the existence of sharecropping or traditional landlord-tenant relations. Much
mischief has thus been done by imprecise application. There is nothing to be gained from rehearsal of the
"mode-of-production" debate which energized subcontinental scholarship for a time. In the context of
Kerala, feudalism clearly contained the core elements of political decay and decentralization implied by
the usage of Marc Bloc, as well as the "unfreedom" and "personal dependence" stressed by Marx as
resulting from "the attachment of men as an adjunct to the land." As Hobsbawm (1965:42 ff) notes, Marx
was more concerned with what feudalism spawned than with precise analysis of its defining features.
Variations within European feudalism (eg Anderson, 1974: Part II) in any case prevent any strict derivation
of necessary components to define the concept. That individuals were "attached" as "an adjunct to the
land" and experienced "personal unfreedom" dissimilar to that of commoditized markets in labor
characteristic of capitalism seems clear.

Logan (1887:67 1) argues that the derivation of <b><i>pattam</i></b> ,

combination of <b><i>padu</i></b> (authority's) and

clearly true is that the <b><i>kanakkar'</i></b>s
appropriation of <b><i>pattam</i></b> as rent was 
tantamount to expropriation of public revenue, only a part of which
was traditionally due the Nairs as payment for 
their supervisory and executive functions under feudal

Conrad Wood gives an example which illustrates this point nicely. Three participants in the 1852
outbreak were officially classified as "day labourers," but 
their father was a <b><i>vermupattakkaran</i></b> who had
been evicted "from a plot he had held for many years (1978:146). Wood (ibid 133) summarizes the status
of participants as"wage-workers [field laborers, 
porters, timber-floaters], poor tenants, ... <b><i>mullas</i></b> of
barely-distinguishable economic standing, criminals on the point of having their careers cut short by
authority, the chronically diseased, and men who were rather more comfortably-off but who, often, had
experienced economic decline." Official accounts add "mendicants and others of the lowest class, living
from hand to mouth."

The term is Hobsbawm's. Conrad Wood uses the example of Athan Gurikal to illustrate the social
banditry component of the movement. His "gang" supported itself by levies on rich landlords and Gurikal
"set himself up as champion of the oppressed Moplahs, among whom he enjoyed great prestige"
(1978:143-144). Social banditry is redistributive and hostile to property relations established by the state
(and thus to the state), but is "pre-political" in the sense that no positive political project is entailed.
