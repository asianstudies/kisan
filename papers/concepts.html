 <hr>
  Walter Hauser's work has been profoundly concerned  with
 political and protest movements from below and  from within. His
 perspective has been that of the  underdog and the protester. and
 over many years he  has steeped himself in the society and life of
 Bihar  (as well as its records) in order to explore its history.  He has
 influenced generations of scholars by this  approach. By contrast, I
 have focused my attention  on the colonial state, at a time when
 understandable  distrust of colonial and Eurocentric exaggerations 
 of its role (a tendency inherent in official documents),  combined
 with anti-colonial sentiment, have led  to assumptions that it was of
 minimal importance,  and also monolithic. I suggest that the state
 has  been neglected, partly because it arouses  this kind of distaste.
 Criticisms of 'elitism' have been  levied against me, even in respect
 of a paper  written in the 1970s in which I sought to subvert a 
 conference and volume on 'leadership' by  arguing against 'directive
 interpretations'_for  example against the notion that 'popular 
 agitations were brought into being by  agitators', against attributing
 Shahabad cow-protection  riots to 'positive leadership' without
 attending  to the 'self-assertion'  of so-called  followers, and
 against Judith Brown's idea that  pre-Gandhian Champaran was
 politically 'latent'.<a  name="rf01"></a><a 
 href="#N_01_"><sup><b>1</b></sup></a>  My  stance has always
 been that questions have  many aspects, that elites and underlings in 
 the end need to be examined together because  they interact, and
 that the proper study of the  colonial Indian state is a necessary part
 of an  overall picture.<p>
 
    Thus this paper will not pretend to follow Hauser's
 example, but instead will suggest some ways in which it may
 usefully be supplemented by an approach and interest which at first
 sight may appear antagonistic to it, but which (I argue) is its
 necessary adjunct. The essay restates some former perspectives
 which may be being lost as historical emphases change. It seeks to
 relate British colonial categorisations of India to the evolution of the
 Indian state and the emergence of Indian identities and political
 organization. A nation-state is formed in territory from supposedly
 shared characteristics and constituent classes among citizens; the
 nation-state also implies a national purpose moderated by the state. 
 Hence this essay briefly discusses issues of indigenous categories,
 but focuses  on the questions of physical and legal
 frontiers, then languages, and finally the historical idea of the
 peasant, in the context of a regulating and 'improving' government.
 It considers the impact of colonial officials' ideas, measurements and
 would-be reforms upon the emergence and character of the South
 Asian nations. Such a field, though already well traversed, is so
 huge that the treatment must be partial and tentative. Appropriate
 attention is paid to peasants in Bihar. But the peasant is treated as
 one among other parallel identities of a kind necessary to the
 construction of the 'nation'.<p>
 
 A very fine example of the approach encouraged by
 Hauser is a recent book by William Pinch, which examines the
 peasant assertiveness which, he tells us, arose out of religious and
 social attitudes and changed.<a  name="rf02"></a>
 <a href="#N_02_"><sup><b>2</b></sup></a> 
 For example, he describes peasants
 thinking of themselves as <i>kshatriya</i> rather than <i>shudra,
 </I>or <i>sadhus</i> articulating Vaishnava and hence relatively
 egalitarian ambitions as an underpinning for agrarian radicalism.
 Pinch does not deny that there were external influences in
 promoting changes, noting for example Ashis Nandy's and others'
 insistence that an emphasis on 'masculinity' was an anti-colonial
 <i>response</i> or, as Pinch puts it, 'a coming to terms' with
 colonially-reconstructed hierarchy and terminology. But his
 emphasis is on the indigenous forces of change. On the other hand,
 he does not support the extreme versions of a concept of 'subaltern'
 autonomy. Rather, he sets himself against the colonial stereotyping
 which criticised <i>sadhus</i> as 'men in disguise' (Sleeman's
 phrase) <i>because</i> they could be drawn from any caste or
 community, or as dangerous frauds because they were 'political'
 rather than 'religious' in their aims. Thus Pinch seeks to re-assert the
 religious element of peasant sensibility and politics, on a broad
 definition of what is religious.<p>
 
   Implicit in his account is a recognition that debates about
 the degrees of colonial or 'external 'influence on 'indigenous'
 processes of change are less interesting than examinations of the
 logic of the processes themselves. Because social forms evolve
 continually in conjunction with historical and
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 2</b>] 
 
 rhetorical forces, so the distinction between internal and
 external features continually dissolves. The key questions concern
 how the actors in each drama fashion events and identities out of the
 variety of components available to them. This makes it
 unsatisfactory to privilege the 'external', as in versions of
 modernization theory. By the same argument one also should not
 privilege the 'internal' as if it were immutable, essential and wholly
 autochthonous. In less cautious hands than those of Pinch, and in
 current Indian debates, this principle has been readily overturned. It
 is certainly violated in current notions about distinct and antagonistic
 religious civilizations', notions which are essentialist or primordialist
 but ahistorical.<a  name="rf03"></a><a 
 href="#N_03_"><sup><b>3</b></sup></a><p>
 
 One therefore is entitled to ask once again what was the
 role in peasant mobilization of the old stalwarts of the growth of the
 state and its standardizations; of the emergence of new institutions,
 professions and expectations; of the growth, increased speed and
 reduced cost of communications ,through transport, language and
 print: of an increasingly shared economic and political experience;
 of the awareness of Western ideas and examples in regard to the
 nation and to class, to individual or equitable 'rights'. It cannot be
 that such influences played no part, for example in peasant
 mobilization or consciousness. Nor did indigenous or religious
 forces operate in some kind of pristine arena. As others have
 noticed, to assume that they did is merely to produce a new
 Orientalism.<a  name="rf04"></a>
 <a href="#N_04_"><sup><b>4</b></sup></a>  
 How then  did the religious and inherited elements
 emphasised by Pinch combine and react with selective borrowings
 from other traditions and reactions to new circumstance, such as I
 have tried to examine?<p>
 
 <center><a name="one"><b>I</b></a></center><br>
 
  I begin with rural society. The predominant forms of
 socio-political organization in pre-colonial times seem to have been
 the household, the local community, the caste and the kingdom. But
 the household alone is the focus of <i>Krsi-parasara,</i> 
 <a  name="rf05"></a>
 <a href="#N_05_"><sup><b>5</b></sup></a> one of
 the few early works devoted to agriculture and hence informative on
 the status and role of cultivators. By its account the society is by no
 means unstratified, but the kingdom is only just mentioned. caste
 barely referred to (though purity is required of those performing
 rites),<a  name="rf06"></a>
 <a  href="#N_06_"><sup><b>6</b></sup></a> 
 and the community visible only on a few occasions involving
 agricultural and seasonal rituals.<a  name="rf07"></a><a 
 href="#N_07_"><sup><b>7</b></sup></a> Cultivating households are implied
 to be the norm. Within them the householder's father is to be put in
 charge of the <i>zenana</i>, his mother to be placed in the kitchen,
 the householder personally to manage the cultivation. and a person
 'like himself' to be set to supervise the cattle. The only people of
 different kind directly mentioned are cowherds and kings.<p>
 
 On the other hand a strong emphasis on supervision
 (well-supervised agriculture producing gold and poorly-supervised
 poverty) implies that the household contained or employed other
 workers. That workers were employed is reinforced by comments
 relating degrees of comfort to the numbers of ploughs for each
 household -- five to ten implying wealth, two or three a bare
 sufficiency, and one indebtedness. There are hints too in the
 observation that the good husbandman cares not only for rituals and
 for cattle. but also for the welfare of other people. Sumit Guha has
 provided a portrait of a peasant household's labouring dependents
 which might well serve as a model for the relations implied
 here's.<a  name="rf08"></a><a 
 href="#N_08_"><sup><b>8</b></sup></a><p>
 
 An undifferentiated picture, amidst hints of stratification,
 implies a lack of self-consciousness about the status of the peasant.
 On the other hand, <i>Krsi-parasara</i> also embodies an image of
 the cultivator and a eulogy on his status and importance. In addition
 to having the attributes already mentioned, 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 3</b>]  
 
 the ideal cultivator is
 energetic, regular in attendance in the fields, and knowledgeable
 about seasons, rainfall, signs and portents, and seeds. He is the
 linchpin of society, on whom others, however wealthy, must
 depend; to whom they come as supplicants. Do these attributes and
 distinctions after all imply a self-consciousness and a practical
 solidarity on the part of cultivators <i>as a class</i>?<p>
 
 One may take up the same question towards the end
 of the early modern era by an interpretation of the early colonial
 reports, such as those of Buchanan-Hamilton. We might expect, in
 Marxian terms and following the work of C.A. Bayly in particular,
 that the colonial state's successful drive for settled agriculture was a
 necessary pre-requisite for the evolution of a range of agricultural
 classes, at least beyond the gentry and merchants for whom Bayly
 ascribes an earlier existence.<a  name="rf09"></a><a 
 href="#N_09_"><sup><b>9</b></sup></a> 
 However, in Purnea, for example, one
 finds Buchanan reporting a fairly clear range of socio-economic
 categories in the early nineteenth century.<a  name="rf10"></a><a 
 href="#N_10_"><sup><b>10</b></sup></a> First came the
 dominant and independent rural elite, the zamindars, augmented by
 area intermediaries: the zamindari dewan and other agents, and
 revenue-farmers <i>(mostajirs)</i>.  Next came village elites, people
 outside the <i>mostajirs'</i> authority (those occupying unassessed
 land, paying low rents in perpetuity, or paying directly to the
 zamindars; and all high castes, Hindu and Muslim, 'exempted from
 rent for their houses and gardens'). Such elites, and perhaps some
 other landholders, expressed their dominance by employing and
 controlling labour, including one specialist ploughman for every six
 cattle. In another category were village officers, the watchmen and
 messengers. Then came other cultivators <i>(adhiyars)</i> who
 held land through <i>mostajirs</i> or other agents  .Finally were
 the slaves and poor labourers who at least 'procured room for their
 houses from those for whom they work'. Within this broad pattern,
 types of tenure also certainly existed, their names and character
 briefly recorded by Buchanan -- various kinds and degrees of
 fixed-rent tenants, tenants in perpetuity, short-leaseholders and so
 on.<a  name="rf11"></a><a 
 href="#N_11_"><sup><b>11</b></sup></a><p>
 
 Such categories (not being wholly invented by
 Buchanan) must imply that some solidarities were perceived by the
 people themselves. A social consensus was at work for example
 when, as Buchanan noted, the people showed a propensity to
 conceal information of which they were perfectly aware. (The East
 India Company was gullible enough to accept such partial and
 improbable reports.) But many other indications suggest a limit
 upon common identities. First, there were large numbers of servants
 and hired workers in Purnea, but outsiders found it very difficult to
 obtain labour: workers could not escape the vertical control
 provided by debt bondage. Secondly, broader identities were
 expressed, but possibly, like caste and community, cut across the
 economic strata: 'more than half the Hindus',reported Buchanan,
 'consider themselves as belonging to foreign nations, either from the
 west of India or Bengal, although many of them have no tradition
 concerning the time of their emigration and may have no knowledge
 of the particular part of the country from whence they came'.
 Thirdly, among such broad categories, caste was plainly fluid. For
 example, as 'Hindu law' was strongly enforced, the numerous
 high-caste families found 'great difficulty in procuring proper
 marriages for their daughters'.  Should they fail before the onset of
 puberty, as often they did, daughter and parents risked disgrace. 
 Some then would convert to Islam, according to Buchanan, and
 some be 'lowered to an inferior degree' of society.<a  name="rf12"></a>
 <a href="#N_12_"><sup><b>12</b></sup></a>  Fourthly, castes
 were also ambiguous as occupational categories. Buchanan records
 many which were not confined to their 'proper profession'. Only ten
 per cent of Maithila Brahmans 'studied] more or less, and reject[ed]
 service', some 'carr[ied] arms', and more than two-thirds 'occup[ied]
 lands...and attend[ed] chiefly to their cultivation'. Lavana Brahmans
 lived 'entirely by commerce'. Rajputs would not 'condescend to such
 drudgery' as to hold the plough, except that one in eight did so,
 while others were traders or went for service in other districts.
 Mithila Kayasthas still adhered 'to the proper duties of their caste,
 being writers and accountants, but many rent[ed] land 'without
 cultivating it themselves. Many Telis (oilmen) worked as traders.
 Finally, nonetheless, considerations of 'purity' did matter.
 Buchanan refers to the many castes of 'pure cultivators' and others
 apparently confined in practice to their ritual occupation. Small
 sections, such as Malis who worked as garland-makers,
 were 'admitted to be a very pure order of Sudras', and similar
 positions of relative prestige seemed to adhere to potters,
 blacksmiths, and barbers, all of whom 'generally 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997 <b>++Page 4</b>]  
 
 confine[d] their labours to their profession . Similarly,
 impure and vile' castes identified by Buchanan reflected their actual
 occupations. though also, apparently, 'aboriginal origin'.
 <a  name="rf13"></a>
 <a href="#N_13_"><sup><b>13</b></sup></a><p>
 
 All these distinctions affected the rights and perceptions,
 and hence divided the body, of tenants and cultivators. Above all, a
 class identity for 'cultivators' was unlikely because avoidance of
 physical labour was important for the higher castes, who also paid
 lower rents, and held their household plots free. Generally, social
 categories were of mixed basis - caste, tenure and occupation all
 being important but not consistently determinant. And they derived
 from hierarchical and dependent relations more than from
 horizontal commonalities.<p>
 
 <p align=center><a name="two"><b>II</b></a><p>
 
 Into this setting came the colonial state. To assess its
 influence, we need first to move from the particular to the general.
 British administration has been blamed tor creating or codifying
 social divisions in India, especially between castes and religious
 communities. Its influence was always malign; the divisions it
 constructed ever artificial. Behind this interpretation lie unspoken
 assumptions of a golden noncommunal age, a pre-colonial era of
 social harmony.<a  name="rf14"></a>
 <a href="#N_14_"><sup><b>14</b></sup></a>   
 A possible qualification of this approach
 therefore reasserts the existence of primordialism in some sense, or
 at least of inheritances and continuities, of already-established
 categories which were embellished and politicised by the state.
 Pinch's account comes close to that correction, for example when he
 shows how <i>sadhus</i> were constructed as 'religious' by British
 observers. A different qualification would reassess the positive
 contribution of the colonial era to the appearance or 'indigenisation'
 of other kinds of identity. That possibility is
 considered shortly, but first we need to reflect on the
 nature of the colonial codifications.<p>
 
 Establishing definite borders and jurisdictions was part of
 the transformation in government in India. The borders allowed
 certain rules to be applied, on principle, by the British officials. That
 administrative revolution can be linked to new roles perceived for
 the state, and those roles to the rise of nations and in some cases the
 democratic or contractual arguments which came to justify the
 state's existence. At one level this produces the usual Foucauldian
 points. Such developments in Europe resulted from a kind of
 colonial process, and were given impetus by the acquisition of
 empire. France and England (not least in Tudor times) contained
 metropolitan cores which colonised and subjugated their peripheries:
 this work needed a bureaucracy and standardization as well as force.
 Liberty and democracy sought to legitimise the change. These
 nations, inspired by exploration, science, and industrialisation (all
 part of their own mobilization), then turned their attention to
 external colonization, building empires, and justifying them on the
 excuse of trade, law, good government, improvement and so on 
 -- claims which once again demanded the development of new
 administrative and political structures. Similar processes occurred, in
 different ways, with the unification of Germany or Italy, and the
 imperial, continental expansions of Russia or the United States.
 Stronger military and economic powers sustained and justified these
 expansions. The difference and distance between core and
 periphery, as perforce between alien coloniser and subject people,
 required intervention and control organised according to new
 principles -- by bureaucracy and codified law, by centralized states,
 and, as has become increasingly important, by communications
 and information technology, starting with secure highways 
 and with print.<p>
 
 It may thus be obvious why a colonial power should seek to expand 
 the state.  Many immediate practical explanations are usually put 
 forward -- not least fear and self-interest.  These were acutely felt 
 by an alien power but were not peculiar to the colonial context.  The 
 French revolution hastened political concession in England, just as 
 cholera epidemics concentrated minds on the need for measures to 
 improve public health and sanitation.  The 'benign'  
 efforts of the elites and the state were never disinterested. In Britain
 state expansions of the later nineteenth-century paralleled those
 fostered in India by local government and taxation, railways and
 irrigation, military recruitment, or contract and property laws. In
 Britain as in India there were clearly attempts to legitimise and
 preserve the political, social and economic system by encouraging
 all citizens to value it -- for example by investing the lower orders
 with an appreciation or even the enjoyment of property, or of high
 culture through education, both of these being repeated ploys from
 (at least) Gladstone to Thatcher. In India too there were concerns
 over public order, worries about poverty, and threats to property
 and interests; there was embarrassment at the moral drawn, by
 nationalist critics, from the incidence of famines and other apparent
 failures of policy. One of Dadabhai Naoroji's shrewdest thrusts was
 in the title of his famous polemic, the jibe of 'un-British rule', which
 both accepted and attacked the pretensions of colonial 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>,1997 <b>++Page 5</b>]  
 
 power.<p>
 
 One question still to be fully explored is how far the administrative
 revolution in India involved direct borrowings from Europe, or
 when Britain was the imitator of India (contrary to what is usually
 supposed). The use of India as a 'laboratory' by the radicals of the
 early nineteenth century has often been noted, since Eric Stokes
 pointed it out,
 <a  name="rf15"></a>
 <a href="#N_15_"><sup><b>15</b></sup></a> 
 and the later contacts between leading British
 reformers and India were also very great. On the other hand, several
 influential thinkers had personal experience of Indian administration
 and in most cases of India (the Mills, Macaulay, Maine, Fitzjames
 Stephen and so on), and the Indian example, as constructed by them,
 was prominent in many debates. Certainly, new ideas of the purpose
 of government had intervened. But had they not done so. in part,
 because larger state systems were paid for by empire, and it was
 empire which needed them'? This was equally true of technology,
 professionalization and cheaper, faster communications, which
 provided the means, and of ideologies, or indeed public conscience
 and morality, which provided the rationalizations. The use of
 strategic groups -- the educated, the collaborators -- helped the process,
 as did symbols, ceremonies and rituals.
 <a  name="rf16"></a>
 <a href="#N_16_"><sup><b>16</b></sup></a> 
 Surely empire set the agenda.<p>
 
 A related question is why the British wanted not only an
 empire but a 'virtuous' colonization, whether as envisaged by E.G.
 Wakefield for colonies of settlement or for the raj in India? Here too
 the exigencies of ruling India may have been significant. Just as it
 was no accident that doctrines of the state's responsibility and
 necessary benevolence gained momentum in England when the
 Tudors were seeking legitimacy, as a new dynasty of dubious
 lineage; so too it is interesting that similar ideas came to the fore
 among some who, two hundred years later, were establishing the
 even less plausible rule of the English East India Company in India.
 In neither case was 'benignity' the only aspect of the campaign, but
 certainly in both cases it was admitted that 'Public Advantage'
 (meaning the security of the regime) could be served by ensuring the
 public good. One Company servant wrote in 1809 (in phrase soften
 to be echoed) of the desirability of encouraging any 'Natives
 who...distinguished themselves [by]...inculcating just ideas of the
 justice and beneficence of our Nation and Government in the
 remote parts of our...recent acquisitions'.
 <a  name="rf17"></a>
 <a href="#N_17_"><sup><b>17</b></sup></a>  
 This search for
 legitimacy, through at least a seeming benevolence, gained another
 fillip in the later nineteenth century when British rulers were once
 again re-thinking their role; the accompaniment was yet further
 expansion of the state. Thus arise what might be called
 environments of change -- forces of ideas and action that move
 societies in a certain direction.<p>
 
 If self-interest provided a fundamental motivation,
 another element, the intellectual, set the channels along which policy
 was most likely to flow. It was likewise poised between the common
 experience of states and the peculiar circumstances of colonial India.
 Christianity was important, particularly that strand which can be
 traced to St. Augustine, his distinction between the city of God and
 that of fallen Man or the Devil, and his exhortations to
 perfectability, for an earthly 'progress'. Many British officials
 regarded it as their task to advance a godly improvement in India.
 The great imperial federationist, Lionel Curtis -- writing during the
 decline of the modern empires and after the rise of new international
 bodies; and in the Augustinian tradition of world history -- traced
 political progress through self-governing nations to an international
 commonwealth which would reflect the common nature of all
 mankind.<a  name="rf18"></a>
 <a href="#N_18_"><sup><b>18</b></sup></a>  
 Of course private, kingly and religious charity existed in
 India as or more than in Europe; the point here is merely that
 Christian preaching endorsed developing forms of public altruism.
 Generally, one should not underestimate the potency in a mainly
 Christian ICS of the imagery of the Fall and the Redemption, and the
 tradition of alms, especially when mixed with Enlightenment views
 of progress, an imperialist 'mission', and a Smithian belief in trade.
 To the Western mind, imperial history demonstrated the natural
 imposition of a superior, Christian culture, and thereby imposed a
 responsibility.<p>
 
 Where religious fervour waned, it was replaced by belief
 in the inevitable march of rational science, of Western knowledge.
 The universalist and evangelical tendencies of both 'religions' led
 tithe assumption that societies evolve in one direction, and hence
 that social laws could be discovered and exploited: the idea that all of
 humankind is essentially the same was probably more important
 and indeed more imperialist, than the equally ancient notion that
 there are tribes or races which differ fundamentally. (The seesaw
 between these two poles constituted a basic debate of social theory;
 and in 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997 <b>++ Page 6</b>]  
 
 the nineteenth century it was concentrated. in no small part, upon India.) <p>
 
 British officials in India had also been 
 subjected to a more secular moral education as
 to the proper goals of life and work, especially after the introduction
 of the competition system and the reforms of the public schools and
 universities in Britain, but also by training and example within India.
 They were deliberately inculcated with the kind of reasoning inserted
 or reinforced in the English national consciousness by Shakespeare's
 notion of the worthy steward (in <i>Measure for Measure, Richard
 III</i> and soon), which had flowered over the centuries in any
 number of other political and philosophical ideas.  Doctrines both
 follow and prescribe practice: the state's role extended as more
 people were found to be part of the nation. and, as the nation
 evolved. so too did the theories to explain it and make it
 seem foreordained. We can see this readily enough in the East India
 Company's attempts to co-opt private virtue to the cause of public
 government in late eighteenth-century Bengal; or in the evoked
 heroes of state and empire, renowned for their probity and civic
 virtue, starting in the Indian case with Clive. This tradition was
 quarrelsome, but adhered to agreed qualities of character and
 achievement.  Macaulay, along with innumerable biographers a major
 exponent of the tendency, criticised Clive for his personal ostentation
 and pecuniary rapacity, but praised his 'strong will' and 'firmness',
 his' constitutional intrepidity', his 'hearty' capacity for friendship, his
 freedom from 'cunning' <i>in dealings with his own countrymen,</i> 
 his 'creditable use of his riches', his espousal of necessary
 reforms, his distinction as a soldier and statesman in the service of
 his country, his rescue of Bengal from a 'whole crew of [European]
 pilferers and oppressors', and in general his 'truth and merit'.
 <a  name="rf19"></a>
 <a href="#N_19_"><sup><b>19</b></sup></a> <p>
 
 We also see the creation of national interests and
 responsibilities more generally with the development of the modern
 learned and regulated professions (in Europe and India), from the
 late eighteenth century. We see it too in the political thinking
 developing in Britain. Even in Hobbes, for example, there is a clear
 acceptance that the state derives from some kind of contract
 between ruler and ruled: though a monarch was sovereign, his title
 depended on a covenant with his subjects.
 <a  name="rf20"></a>
 <a href="#N_20_"><sup><b>20</b></sup></a>   
 Hume's principles of
 morality supposed not only that different nations had different
 customs and values (as also in race theory), but also that civilization
 advanced when beneficence and justice -- <i>public</i> virtues -- reduced the
 central importance, in more barbarous
 nations, of courage, an <i>individual</i> quality.
 <a  name="rf21"></a>
 <a href="#N_21_"><sup><b>21</b></sup></a>  
 Thus the English
 debates of the seventeenth. eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were
 not really about the existence of a contract between state and subject,
 nor whether history was a progress from individual to public virtue.
 They concerned the proper roles of government and the means of
 achieving progress and of defining the public.<p>
 
 Comparable indigenous notions of state and indeed
 private responsibility were undoubtedly important in India. But that
 is not to say that the form in which these concepts now exist in
 India, and the manner in which they are effected, have not been
 profoundly influenced by the experience of British rule. In the
 creation of present forms and effects, it probably mattered that an
 exaggerated idea of the importance of rulers, easy enough for the
 landed gentry and the members of a sovereign parliament, was even
 more appropriate and satisfying, indeed self-serving, for the
 administrators of a subject empire. Self-importance went with the
 job. But additionally there was consensus about the economic and
 social goods that could or should be forged by state power and law.
 If the Western scientific and technological revolution encouraged a
 belief that everything was knowable and hence improveable, then in
 India the state and its law were expected to be instruments of this
 knowledge and improvements, as were communications, trade,
 education, Christianity, or medicine. Improved connections,
 bureaucratic structures and the establishment of firm boundaries
 implied that notions of responsibility would keep pace with these
 determinants of what  was possible, resulting in the 'rational'
 and instrumentalist concepts of a national government and people, a
 national economy and income, and national interests.  The 'altruistic'
 public state allowed or required nationalism as its counterpart.<p>
 
 Originally, in colonial India, an intellectual and
 universalist confidence was inherited from the Enlightenment. But
 the state's interventions had been limited by practical ignorance,
 fears of corruption or rejection, and doctrines of sectional interests,
 of minimalism, or of laissez-faire. In the earlier phases of Company
 rule the state rather tended to withdraw from localities and from
 aspects of responsibility. But this had generated continual debates
 between the local officers or enthusiasts, who 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 7</b>]  
 
 were close to problems or
 opportunities and willing to take responsibility, and the central
 authorities in Calcutta or, especially. London. who were more
 influenced by principles of political economy and non-intervention.
 Two consequences flowed even then. Firstly, there was commonly a
 considerable degree of intervention at lower or semi-detached levels
 of the administration, half-concealed from higher authority. Many
 'experts' pursued their private obsessions. Secondly, major
 cataclysms provided the occasions to draw central government into
 new spheres of activity. Famine in the 1830s led directly to attempts
 to improve the infrastructure (public works, canals,
 communications),
 <a  name="rf22"></a>
 <a href="#N_22_"><sup><b>22</b></sup></a>  
 and famines from the 1860s to 1880s
 encouraged such social engineering as the 1885 Bengal Tenancy
 Act.  Gradually therefore the sense of effective responsibility
 widened. Laissez-faire allowed the building of infrastructure and the
 removal of supposed immorality, inefficiency and impediments to
 trade. Before too long wider socio-economic interference was
 contemplated. Expectations were created among Indians. The moral
 of both colonial and nationalist rhetoric was that the state's role was
 to ensure public good, and that private interests should be made
 public, reconciled, and organised.<p>

  One of the large questions to be considered in assessing
 European influence is the extent to which Western categorizations
 distorted India. The distortion too is usually assumed from the
 exercise of power, even though the power was never absolute. More
 interesting perhaps is to consider the relationship between
 categonsation -- the ideas behind policies -- and the state's impact. An
 initial problem was(and is) a misuse of history and the application of
 pseudo-science. As a study, history deals largely with the
 immeasurable and with human and not mechanical agency; it must
 be inexact; it does not produce general laws which explain or predict
 the answers to particular questions. Its method implies a conceptual
 (if hardly a practical) distinction between observation and
 identification -- that is, an ideal, an attempt, of moving from the one to
 the other, of 'discovering' structure as far as possible on the basis of
 information rather than pre-classification. This means a habitual
 suspicion of preconceptions, whether workaday concepts or grand
 theories. The administrator-historians of India, like
 subsequent polemicists, too often broke these rules. Their
 transgression was the more serious because the myth of rationality
 and objectivity was used to conceal a multitude of pernicious
 assumptions. It is now a cliche to note that subjectivity is
 unavoidable. contributing to choices of subject and model-building,
 and that objective reality (assuming it exists) cannot even be
 approached except through our own concerns and language. But this
 does not mean that European observers of India (or anyone else)
 cannot be judged for different degrees of bias. Considerations of
 data may be either more or less ideological. A recognisable line is
 crossed, when concepts and a <i>priori</i> notions no longer
 merely stimulate inquiries, or order and help communicate
 knowledge, but replace and prevent the specific interpretation of
 information.  Nineteenth-century officials certainly produced much
 that did not transgress by these criteria, but at key points they were
 limited by preconceptions and prejudice.<p>
 
 Specific contributions were made by thinkers such as
 Adam Smith, relating technological improvement to a rational man's
 desire to save labour and improve wealth, or Marx, concerned with
 the political context of different roles in production and exchange, or
 Darwin, extending the notion of evolution and the methods of
 science to cover the entire natural order. But, given the prominent
 of legal and agrarian questions, perhaps the single most important
 influence on British Indian officials in the later nineteenth century
 was Henry Maine, who erected a theory around the social factor as
 expressed in law. For a generation, his work crystallized a gamut of
 intellectual change into a single compelling explanation of Indian
 society and of history, the well-known distinction between
 status, whereby people were subjected to custom and collective will,
 and contract, which regulated behaviour only as a general body of
 civil legislation based on the integrity of the individual decision. In
 nineteenth-century India the British sought settled agricultural
 populations for reasons of power and trade; Maine added to this
 pragmatism a belief that earlier social forms survived in India, but
 that they were universal or at least Indo-European and hence capable
 of evolution towards 'modernity', towards a single 'rational' law, if
 suitably encouraged. This both explained and justified foreign rule.
 It did so better, or with a more optimistic and liberal gloss, than the
 alternative notion of Asia's essential difference and inferiority. Such
 general presumptions demanded new categories, or at least forged
 new understandings of existing ones. Emphases were changed; social
 ideas reformulated.<p>
 
 On the other hand, Maine's influence was most potent
 when combined with fears and doubts (to which he also contributed)
 about the pace and cost -- if not the direction and inevitability -- of
 change.<p>
 
  [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 8</b>]  <p>
 
   The supposedly indigenous
 was also privileged. The late nineteenth-century accounts believed in
 science and evolution and modernity, but shared in the alternative
 romanticism which privileged the past and the comminutes -- as much.
 ironically, in the minds of conservative administrators as in the
 claims of nationalists. The origins of this thinking lay not only in the
 classifications of rationality but in far earlier notions of 'Nature,
 hierarchy, and pastoralism (the very ones challenged by the
 scientific and technological revolution). British officials. alongside
 other historicists, regretted some of the consequences in Europe
 from industrialization, market-forces and urbanization, and feared
 the social and political impact of the division of labour which these
 changes forced upon peasant communities in India, as defined by
 Maine. These views were both nostalgic and teleological. The
 idealised peasant was a foil for the wage-labourer of the 'dark
 Satanic mills', and even the despotism under which peasants lived
 could be regretted in the face of ever more bureaucratic systems of
 power. In autocracy could be found a role for heroes and gentlemen,
 and for chivalry, and <i>noblesse oblige,</i> all of which were
 smuggled into the British conception of their role in India. To add
 the Christian gloss upon this, one might note John Bunyan's
 portrayal, as both origin and goal, of a purer, isolated, equitable
 society, once again in a <i>City of God</i> -- exactly contrary to
 Hobbes' <i>Leviathan.</i> Punjab officials, for example,
 sometimes sounded as if they thought they found the remnants or
 prospect of this godly society in the region under their rule, in the
 form of the village community, the martial castes or the sturdy
 peasant proprietor -- and not least when trying to export these social
 models to Bengal and other parts of India.<p>
 
 Thus the habit of justifying policy on an historical basis
 also was engrained by the later nineteenth century, and indeed
 characteristic of British and European thought. To devise
 present-day remedies it was believed necessary to appreciate the
 development of institutions. The tendency found expression in the
 analyses of Philip Francis and his followers in the 1770s, and thus
 also in the permanent settlement; there are ways in which it can be
 seen in Munro's descriptions of society. Historicist ideas, along with
 criticisms of classical political economy, played a particularly crucial
 part in administrative strategies from the 1870s.
 <a  name="rf23"></a>
 <a href="#N_23_"><sup><b>23</b></sup></a>  
 They became the
 current orthodoxy, and were embodied in an outpouring of official
 histories, in settlement reports, studies of castes and tribes, and
 treatises upon rural and agrarian history. However, though some of
 these were more polemical than others, all contributed tithe
 definition and hence control of India. Their function was partly to
 contribute to intellectual debates centred upon Europe -- notably with
 Henry Maine, for example. It was also to regulate the opinions
 and actions of British officials, by defining the people over whom
 they ruled, as was the motivation of such works as Baden-Powell's or
 W.W. Hunter's. In this respect the studies were not conservative but
 the most complete expression of a continual process of colonial rule,
 a stage with its own features and preoccupations. The process built
 upon descriptions of the Mughal zamindar and his accretions
 of hereditary rights in the eighteenth century, of the village
 community as in James Mill's <i>History,</i> and the Fifth Report,
 and of religion and caste, including studies which sought to define
 the settled cultivator as the model subject and citizen, as Sleeman did
 in relation to thagi.
 <a  name="rf24"></a>
 <a href="#N_24_"><sup><b>24</b></sup></a><p>
 
 Elsewhere I have shown how the historical appreciation
 of agrarian conditions in Bihar and Bengal depended on ideological
 assumptions of mixed ancestry.
 <a  name="rf25"></a>
 <a href="#N_25_"><sup><b>25</b></sup></a>
   These appeared repeatedly in the
 official and popular writings of the period. In the standard legal
 commentary on the Bengal Tenancy Act of1885 the introduction
 began by referring to the Code of Manu and its ambiguity about the
 ownership of the soil.<a  name="rf26"></a>
 <a href="#N_26_"><sup><b>26</b></sup></a>  
 Some authorities concluded from the fact
 that revenue was due to the king, that the king owned the land;
 others believed that there was a property residing in the portion of
 the agrarian surplus not owed to the state, and that this descended
 from the rights of original settlement, as surmised in Field's
 <i>Digest</i> of tenancy law.<a  name="rf27"></a>
 <a href="#N_27_"><sup><b>27</b></sup></a>  
 But such conclusions were
 deductive in origin, deriving from theoretical notions of
 property-formation.<p>
 
 For our present purposes it matters that the distortions
 meant that colonial rule never merely perpetuated or replicated
 pre-existing Indian institutions. Rather it re-invented them. Colonial
 officials, like some latter-day social scientists, tended to apply to
 India taxonomies derived from Europe. There are good arguments
 against doing this. Many arguments were available from heterodox
 officials at the 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 9</b>] 
 
 time. But the prevailing
 theories nonetheless took Europe as their reference point. By the
 nineteenth century, with the extension of European empires and the
 improvements in communications, it seemed obvious that many parts
 of the world were experiencing similar changes, especially in trade,
 in relations of production, and in subjection to centralized,
 bureaucratic states and international trends. Certainly some such
 'modernization' occurred in India too. The dominance of Western
 ideas and influence did mean that some of the story, even in India,
 began with the legacy of the Enlightenment, and with new notions of
 categorization, of history and of social science. But all change 
 did not occur on that straightforward basis.<p>
 
  Two main points may be drawn from this initial discussion. 
 First, there were both conservative and radical, Western and 
 Oriental approaches to India.  Second, these new visions were 
 powerful and persistent, and they changed perceptions.  Both, 
 for example, contributed to Indian nationalist discourse -- from 
 Gandhi's sentimentality about village India, equitable caste-society 
 and bread labour or spinning, to Nehru's insistence on industrialization and the
 salience of modern economic class over 'feudal' ties.  The confusions
 of the officials were repeated in the different voices of the
 nationalists. Perhaps this was because both British and Indians drew
 on both Western and Indian experience and concepts.<p>
 
 <p align=center><a name="four"><b>IV</b></a><p>
 
  The new role of the state rested on new categorizations
 and enumerations of society. How might processes of definition
 have affected the ways Indians saw themselves? One obvious
 aspect. and a model for other ones, was the establishment of
 administrative borders, to which relatively little attention has been
 paid, except in the case of the partitions of Bengal in 1905 and of
 India in 1947. Colonial units were codified whether or not they
 reflected existing divisions of land and culture. Imperialism, it seems,
 was always expanding to the limit (by definition perhaps, power is
 never really held in reserve),the initial stage in India having been a
 consolidation of political units directly, through ruling overthrew,
 and the second having occurred when suzerains were ground into
 monarchs, regions into states, between the mills of rival empires.
 <a  name="rf28"></a>
 <a href="#N_28_"><sup><b>28</b></sup></a>    
 A small but interesting example is the state of Bhutan. In
 the eighteenth century and the early nineteenth, the British rulers of
 Bengal were confused by this country in which spiritual and secular
 authority (neither aspect clearly supreme) was exercised over
 people rather than territory; they were infuriated when the people
 made seasonal migrations into what they considered Bengali
 territory. Yet this same Bhutan, apparently so isolated, is today
 concerned about the integrity of its people in their own national land
 and quarrelling on these grounds with Nepali settlers -- Nepal of
 course being another modern construction.
 <a  name="rf29"></a>
 <a href="#N_29_"><sup><b>29</b></sup></a>   
 The places or regions
 named in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conquests changed
 their nature, their meaning as territories, once they were measured
 and demarcated. The boundaries were reinforced by their
 representations in laws, policies, gazetteers and maps. Such modern
 units, or nations, were significantly different from other cultural
 or geographical divisions.<p>
 
 Maps, like the census, are now seen as defining the
 modern world, and as being, in the hands of states, expressions of
 power, even invitations to conquest. The modern map has a single
 form (in its exact measurements and conventions of representation),
 though it may have different meanings and functions. Like landscape
 painting, it links time and space particularly through measures of
 human significance. Because the map gives a primacy to place -- to
 soil and location mixed with and created by people   then, in the end,
 once its subjects are able to read it, it empowers nations and
 communities rather than conquerors and colonialists. In such a way
 the concept of a single national land, and therefore a continuous
 national history and culture, derived from Western modes of
 understanding boundaries. By itself, however, the map could not
 achieve such a transformation.<p>
 
 Change was not suddenly achieved, for example, in any
 of the categorizations inspired by the colonial state. To take the case
 of state frontiers, the British themselves applied older definitions
 when they suited them -- for example in the so-called buffer state of
 Awadh, where the British Resident exercised extra-territorial
 jurisdiction from 1801 to 1856, especially for and over the
 Awadhi employees of the Company's army.
 <a  name="rf30"></a>
 <a href="#N_30_"><sup><b>30</b></sup></a>    
 At the edges there
 were, and generally there long remained, 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 10</b>]  
 
  frontier zones rather than
 boundaries. In l 891 Sir Alfred Lyall, writing in <i>Nineteenth
 Century,</i> talked of the need to keep 'adjoining' 'foreign territory'
 free from the 'occupation' of 'powerful neighbours': the implication
 was that outside India proper there was another zone which
  was 'foreign' but also transitional, a liminal area over which a
 'protectorate' might be established -- to adopt Curzon's terminology,
 from his essay on <i>Frontiers</i> (1907).<a  name="rf31"></a>
 <a href="#N_31_"><sup><b>31</b></sup></a>    Out of this ambiguity
 arose most of British frontier policy: it tended to draw one or more
 inner lines (not always formally demarcated, even at the end of the
 colonial period), and then to suppose a range of other lines, marking
 kinds of influence or claim, progressing outwards until they met and
 overlapped with similar lines extending from the next supposedly
 fixed border: it might be of China or Russia or Burma or Iran or
 Afghanistan. Inhabitants of border regions, especially Pathan tribes
 in the north-west, tended to dispute or ignore the hard frontiers, just
 as Pindaris had done at an earlier period within what was later
 firmly the arena of British suzerainty. Periodic military expeditions
 had to be mounted to ensure that such Unsettled' peoples stayed
 away from so-called British territory, or accepted British terms and
 influence. Several Afghan wars probed the north-west border, as
 elsewhere did the Younghusband expedition to Tibet early
 this century and the Trade Agents there in the following
 decades.<a  name="rf32"></a>
 <a href="#N_32_"><sup><b>32</b></sup></a><p>
 
 British policy undoubtedly helped export a European
 understanding of states and jurisdictions, but it did not create only
 what were termed 'scientific' frontiers. Pragmatism and
 <i>Realpolitik</i> were added to readily-defensible points to define
 the borders; the lines were always fiercely defended by protocol
 or force of arms but, as already implied, were often mapped only
 after the event, so as to outline some more or less vague and
 unknown territory, hitherto merely named in a treaty or
 annexed  after the conquest of a central point. Though
 geographical features were adduced, even at the early stages,
 these boundaries were not all 'inevitable' or 'natural' barriers, waiting
 to be discovered by a rational analysis of <i>existing</i> strategic
 considerations, let alone <i>existing</i> language, culture, history,
 or institutions. Such strategic or unitary characteristics often had to
 be created or invented. Curzon recognised, in his Romanes lecture of
 1907, this distinction between natural and artificial frontiers.
 <a  name="rf33"></a>
 <a href="#N_33_"><sup><b>33</b></sup></a>33<p>
 
 Moreover such external markers. however firm, did not
 wholly remove the internal frontiers which indicated areas of life
 with which the state did not directly interfere. Analysing the policies
 just referred to, Curzon identified three borders even on the exterior,
 to the north-west of British India: the border of direct administration,
 the frontier of 'active protection' (the Durand line), and the outer
 or strategic frontier, meaning the far, northern and western borders
 of Afghanistan -- which therefore was not a 'buffer state' but a region
 within British influence, representing an outer frontier zone.
 (Curzon's analysis may or may not have been wholly true in
 practice -- if true, then Britain never intended to create a strong and
 viable, if dependent, Afghanistan, and bears a responsibility for the
 present state of that country.) More important, within India proper
 there were certainly similar varieties and degrees of sovereignty and
 control; these exclusions too have had their legacy. The princely
 states offer a different lesson from this perspective, in that they
 limited central jurisdiction; many other confusions and exclusions
 existed within the heart of British India. There was great intrusion
 by the state, but British reservations about security and about Indian
 culture and propensities meant that colonial rule did not
 simply repeat what Habermas called, in regard to Europe, the
 infiltration of the private by the public sphere.
 <a  name="rf34"></a>
 <a href="#N_34_"><sup><b>34</b></sup></a><p>
 
 On the other hand, as is the argument of this paper, we
 should not underestimate the impact on South Asian peoples, to this
 day, of the outer limits, the larger units and the claims for control,
 established during the colonial period. Most of all, it mattered that
 effective central authority was consistently extended within
 territories. British colonial notions of the state contained within them
 impulses for evolution. Thus by small steps in a continual process
 even local Indian governments edged towards the independent
 sovereignty which  they were to be partially granted in 1919.
 For example, they had long bought and sold land for
 various purposes (subject to sanction), using such powers very
 extensively 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 11</b>] 
 
 in the interest of railway
 construction and other public works. We come back to 'altruism'.
 Governments, even the supposedly feeble one in Bengal, were ready
 and indeed often felt constrained to use their 'property' (powers, land
 and income) as an instrument for broader changes -- that is,
 not merely to follow rules and consult the legal niceties, but to
 construct a view of the ultimate public good. This meant that, just as
 land and classes were arranged in rank, so too were priorities and
 benefits, which it was the job of the state to decide. There were
 rules and responsibilities, though there could be trade-offs. For
 example, in 1910 the Bengal government wanted to sell to the Port
 Commissioners in Calcutta a valuable site occupied by the Sibpur
 Engineering College, intending to use the money to re-establish the
 college in Ranchi; but it thought the two interests about equal so that
 the transfer should be on easy terms. The central government
 disagreed and hence invoked different principles of governance;
 though the transaction was approved, a 'market' price had to be
 paid.<a  name="rf35"></a>
 <a href="#N_35_"><sup><b>35</b></sup></a>  
 Such technicalities expressed a <i>special</i> need to bend
 India to the colonial Will, by regulation even of the minutiae, but
 also (and by the same means) a <i>general</i> need to adhere to
 'proper' forms and goals of 'civilized' government under the rule of
 law. By the 1930s, such exercise of local sovereignty was
 very largely in local hands (Indian, or British colonial) and imperial
 authority was reserved only in such areas as monetary and
 constitutional policy or military security.<p>
 
 Thus at each level there was represented a united,
 hegemonic and potentially benevolent state.  Partly for that reason the
 colonial administrative units often took on popular significance.
 Borders were significant and contested. Especially among educated
 contemporaries, they generated loyalties.
 <a  name="rf36"></a>
 <a href="#N_36_"><sup><b>36</b></sup></a>  
 It was the new roles and
 expectations of the state that consolidated popular and rhetorical
 identifications with defined lands and jurisdictions. Of course it
 helped that, in colonial indict, deliberate efforts were made for most
 estates and districts to stick with 'natural' and 'historical' borders, on
 principle and for convenience. Even during British rule boundaries
 tended increasingly to be legitimised according to cultural rather than
 administrative traditions -- a discourse more appropriate for nationalist
 than colonial ideology. But, on the other hand, many divisions,
 provinces and presidencies were too coloured by accident and
 political expediency for their boundaries to be altogether consistently
 drawn.  Here the actions of the state assumed greater importance, but
 still generated identifications. By the later nineteenth century, even
 the limits of Commissioners' divisions (intermediate groupings of
 districts introduced in 1829 as part of important bureaucratic
 reforms) were recognised to be sensitive. On a proposal to change
 divisional boundaries, splitting Patna Division, H.H. Risley wrote in
 1906: 'The question is not merely one of administrative efficiency
 and convenience. We have also, especially at the present time
 [during the anti-partition agitation in Bengal], to reckon with
 popular feeling...'.
 <a  name="rf37"></a>
 <a href="#N_37_"><sup><b>37</b></sup></a>  
 Patna Division was certainly over-large: its
 population was thought to be 15,514,987, whereas that of Bombay
 Presidency, excluding Sind. was 15,304,677. In itself Patna division
 reflected no particular regional or cultural identity of long standing.
 The suggestion that it might be cut in two at the Ganges was
 sensible  in physical and cultural terms. Then, a little less
 plausibly, it was thought that districts might also be reallocated
 westwards (Monghyr to Patna division, and Birbhum or
 Murshidabad to Bhagalpur division), thus relieving pressure on
 Presidency and Burdwan divisions. Support for the changes was
 given in the Government of India on the assurance of the Bengal
 government that there would be no local opposition -- this was the
 'only argument' that appealed. Later the Secretary of State for India
 refused extensive boundary changes because of the political
 climate.<a  name="rf38"></a>
 <a href="#N_38_"><sup><b>38</b></sup></a>  
 Why should administrative divisions have had such
 significance? They still present major problems in India as elsewhere
 in the world.<a  name="rf39"></a>
 <a href="#N_39_"><sup><b>39</b></sup></a>  
 Risley underestimated the 'reality' of sentiment (as
 also in the 1905 partition of Bengal), but he was  right
 when he went on to notice that it was bolstered by self-interest, in
 this case of those likely to be affected  by consequential
 changes in the jurisdictions of the courts.
 <a  name="rf40"></a>
 <a href="#N_40_"><sup><b>40</b></sup></a><p>
 
 An Indian or national perspective  upon
 boundaries and jurisdictions was being forced upon the British.
 It was inherent in the  current concept of the state. People
 valued administrative units because of the rhetoric and
 institutions  which grew up within them; because they were
 presented as cultural and 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 12</b>] 
   
 historical units; because they became familiar and could
 be used as arenas for those seeking reputation and privilege. They
 were far from the only such arenas in India. nor even the most
 important to most people; but clearly they did matter to some.
 Neither wholly primordial nor wholly artificial, such boundaries
 mattered as labels because of the services and interests they
 engendered.<p>
 
 If we consider the physical boundaries alone we can see
 that, with some arguments and battles, the colonial rulers were fairly
 successful in drawing definite lines dividing up different
 jurisdictions -- presidencies, princely states, provinces, divisions,
 districts. landed estates. Rivers kept shifting their courses
 inconveniently, but otherwise most of the internal borders were not
 especially problematic -- though time-consuming at the lowest levels,
 for example in surveying and partition. The British thus reinforced
 the idea of India as a 'natural' geographical entity with obvious
 physical frontiers, which they regarded not as sacred topography, but
 merely as defining the sphere in which they and their state were
 paramount. In the 1920s legal arguments with the state of
 Hyderabad, effectively sparked off by the possibility of a closer
 integration of princely states with British India, made it plain that
 British suzerainty extended throughout the sub-continent.  
 <a  name="rf41"></a>
 <a href="#N_41_"><sup><b>41</b></sup></a> This
 definition of the state was clearly functional(like those of languages,
 or landlord and tenant, also considered here); because it was also
 'public' and state-centred, it set out conditions for the growth of the
 Indian state during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to its
 present predominant position. The British even gave this territory
 clear international status and recognition well before Independence,
 reflected for example in India's founder-membership of the League
 of Nations;<a  name="rf42"></a>
 <a href="#N_42_"><sup><b>42</b></sup></a>
  in 1947 they defined external boundaries that have
 mainly stood the test of war and further partition.<p>
 
 Perhaps the result of continuing ambiguities, whereby
 even major borders were not really fixed and not after all that
 dissimilar to those in traditional Indian views of territory, was
 ultimately not that frontiers remained vague but that they could be
 progressively extended and hardened. The British regarded
 indeterminate zones as survivals from less civilised days, and
 attempted to do away with them. Only occasionally did they confront
 them with the forces of the army or the law. But a gradual process,
 in many senses, had led to the expansion of British territories across
 the subcontinent in the first place; and, though in the later nineteenth
 century the further extensions of territory were only slight, much the
 same process continued to be apparent in the deepening and
 thickening of once imprecise controls, borders and categorizations
 within British India.<p>
 
 These unremarkable points are not made only in order to
 say something about land frontiers. The intention is also to suggest a
 correspondence between categories in general, and particularly an
 analogy between political and social or economic typologies. In the
 latter spheres too colonial government was by no means wholly
 successful in imposing its own borders, laws and institutions on
 Indian practice.  There remained many zones beyond state regulation
 in Indian society. But, on the other hand, as scholars are now
 extremely, perhaps excessively, aware,  there were major
 consequences from the problematic classifications of Indian society
 by the colonial rulers;<a  name="rf43"></a>
 <a href="#N_43_"><sup><b>43</b></sup></a> 
 end many examples of the broader impact of
 apparently trivial administrative changes could also be adduced.<p>

 <p align=center><a name="five"><b>V</b></a><p>
 
  Another paradigm of borders and categorization could be
 the standardization of language. Knowledge of the English language
 by Indians from different regions of course played a part in
 generating and creating the sense of a nation in India. The use of
 English in administration was advocated for efficiency and to reduce
 fraud. A typical example of this impulse is the request by the
 Collector of Champaran district in 1893 to be permitted to keep the
 estates ledger account in English, making use of an English-knowing
 treasury clerk: this would, the Collector argued, 'check many evils,
 facilitate inspection and not cause any inconvenience'. The change
 was approved.<a  name="rf44"></a>
 <a href="#N_44_"><sup><b>44</b></sup></a>  
 However, the direct influence of

 English was small on the
 population at large.<a  name="rf45"></a>
 <a href="#N_45_"><sup><b>45</b></sup></a>   
 Far more important was the role of the state
 in promoting developments in Indian languages.<a  name="rf46"></a>
 <a href="#N_46_"><sup><b>46</b></sup></a>  In the early
 stages state translations of official documents promoted orthography
 and influenced vocabulary; state printing presses, when used for
 non-official purposes, played a major part in developing public
 literary culture. Later the government was influential in further
 defining linguistic boundaries. which, as remarked by G.A. (Pierson,
 the great linguistic expert and earlier a Bihar officer, was 'not always
 an easy matter' because Indian languages tended gradually to 'merge
 into each other'. For example. Grierson's 'mostly uneducated'
 enumerators could not distinguish Bihari and Hindi.<a  name="rf47"></a>
 <a href="#N_47_"><sup><b>47</b></sup></a><p>
 
 Definable languages had undoubtedly existed. in several
 senses, yet they had not been exclusive or standardized, even in
 formal versions and for 'high' purposes. The British helped decide
 which were languages and which dialects, as in the case of Oriya and
 Bengali. There was a dispute in the mid and late nineteenth century
 about the status of Oriya, and pressure for it to be replaced by the
 superior and mutually intelligible Sanskritised Bengali; the pressure
 was resisted, on practical and political grounds, by officials who
 wanted to recognise an equally standardised and Sanskritised,
 printed Oriya.<a  name="rf48"></a>
 <a href="#N_48_"><sup><b>48</b></sup></a>  
 Colonial rule linked each language to a distinct
 written form, to a region, and in some cases to 'race' or religion. In
 Bihar, for example, in the 1870s, Hindi written in Kaithi script had
 been proposed as the standard. Persian script was also proposed, in
 the interests of consistency, in 1876.<a  name="rf49"></a>
 <a href="#N_49_"><sup><b>49</b></sup></a>   According to Grierson,
 Kaithi was used from Bihar to Gujarat 'alongside the more complete
 and elegant Devanagari'; 'Practically speaking, the former may be
 looked upon as the current hand of the latter, though epigraphically
 it is not a corruption of it as some think'.<a  name="rf50"></a>
 <a href="#N_50_"><sup><b>50</b></sup></a> Sir Steuart Bayley, then
 Commissioner in Patna, declared Kaithi to be 'more suitable to the
 wants of the people' (a significant choice of criterion), though he
 agreed that the Nagri script was sometimes used by zamindars.
 <a  name="rf51"></a>
 <a href="#N_51_"><sup><b>51</b></sup></a>
 However, in the same year, 1872, Sir George Campbell,
 Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, had required that all notifications
 and processes be in Nagri, and that <i>amla</i> and police officers learn
 the script within six months.  This practice was followed after 1875
 for all printed materials and returns, though hand-written
 entries were commonly made in Kaithi. The alternative use of
 Persian script was abolished in 1880. Hindi written in Kaithi script
 continued to be used for court proceedings, but in the 1890s Sir
 Charles Elliott's government ordered that, though plaints might be
 presented in any language, all summons, reports and other official
 documents should now also be written in Nagri (when not in
 English). It was further proposed that Nagri should be introduced in
 all primary schools.<p>
 
 Thus standardization proceeded, under government
 sponsorship, though it remained controversial in Bihar: many local
 officials favoured Kaithi even in the 1890s. In 1892 Antony
 MacDonnell, temporarily inheriting the issue, proposed to withdraw
 Elliott's order (to some extent foreshadowing his own policy later in
 the North-Western Provinces).<a  name="rf52"></a>
 <a href="#N_52_"><sup><b>52</b></sup></a>  
 MacDonnell had been convinced
 by a quick survey of signatures and documents in the Patna
 Registration Office, and in Muzaffarpur, that Kaithi was used 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 14</b>] 
 
 overwhelmingly by the few
 Biharis who could write.<a  name="rf53"></a>
 <a href="#N_53_"><sup><b>53</b></sup></a>  
 Again it was Indian usage that was
 supposedly to prevail. But in 1896, Grierson advised that Nagri had
 been systematically taught for some years past in all but the lowest
 classes of the schools'. The Government of India, convinced that
 MacDonnell was exaggerating, instructed that Elliott's order should
 be enforced as far as possible. The local interests of the people had
 vanished, or been reinterpreted by an 'expert'; the change had all
 the hallmarks of linguistic imperialism of the kind experienced in
 Britain or France. Value and political judgments abounded. Elliott
 thought Kaithi 'rough and savage'. so that Nagri could be seen as
 part of a civilising force. Muslims opposed Kaithi, it was said, in the
 hope of an advance for the Persian script.  Hindus supported Kaithi
 for the opposite reason Nagri was presumably 'superior' to Kaithi
 partly by virtue of its association with the Sanskrit past. It was also
 'Hindu', and widely intelligible as 'Hind)'.These were pregnant
 combinations. Unities. once enunciated in one sphere, might be
 assumed for others.<a  name="rf54"></a>
 <a href="#N_54_"><sup><b>54</b></sup></a>  
 Stereotypes were not only necessary to
 definitions and understanding. but contagious, as when Islam came,
 in India between 1917 and 1947, to be equated with Muslim politics
 through a range of political issues.<p>
 
 Today there are recognised languages of Bihar -- Maithili,
 Bhojpuri and so on -- all regarded, more or less, as variants of Hindi
 and written in Nagri. Over two or three generations, old revenue
 and other records, in Kaithi, have become increasingly inaccessible.
 Such language controversies, which were repeated in every part of
 British India, reflected the standardization that was inherent in the
 empire's 'civilizing' mission. The arguments mainly concerned the
 units which were to be consolidated. The spread of 'civilization',
 economic and political linkages, and administrative convenience all
 required the units to be large: in this spirit, many officials wanted to
 remove barriers, and imagined hierarchies of languages and dialects.
 of localities, regions and overarching, national identities. the greater
 in each case subsuming the lesser. One may compare the Punjab
 more recently. In the words of the 1961 Census of India, marking
 another transition: 'there was a move to return the two main mother
 tongues on the basis of religion' (Hind) by Hindus, and Punjabi by
 Sikhs), though 'the population returning Punjabi as mother tongue
 was more than the population returning themselves as Sikhs'.
 <a  name="rf55"></a>
 <a href="#N_55_"><sup><b>55</b></sup></a><p>
 
 Some of the colonial standardization was beyond doubt
 shallow or imposed. Accordingly, in Bihar in recent years there have
 been some attempts by regional or linguistic 'nationalists' to replace
 Nagri by Kaithi or other distinctive scripts.<a  name="rf56"></a>
 <a href="#N_56_"><sup><b>56</b></sup></a>  
 The re-emergence of 
 the local languages at the expense of Hindi was noticed in the 1961
 Census; and, in the 1921 Report for Bihar and Orissa, P.C. Tallents
 had remarked that 'the smaller dialects are taking an unconscionable
 time over dying'. On the other hand, more recent and popular
 linguistic claims depend upon the same criteria of defined historical
 languages and associated peoples and cultures, as assumed by
 Grierson. In his categorization the Bhojpuri. Magadhi and Maithili
 'languages' were grouped as 'Bihar)', and regarded with Bengali and
 Oriya as belonging to an eastern Indo-Aryan group derived from
 Magadha Apabhramsa.<a  name="rf57"></a>
 <a href="#N_57_"><sup><b>57</b></sup></a>  
 Hence 'Bihar)' was a rather artificial term,
 influenced by political nomenclature; by itself it was a language
 claimed by very small numbers of speakers. Though Grierson held
 that Bihari languages were originally of the same family as Bengali,
 he admitted the connection had been severed, since Bihar had been
 'for centuries much more closely connected politically with the
 United Provinces of Agra and Oudh than with Bengal'. One might
 regard this last point as placing a limit on the influence of colonial
 rule, given Bihar's inclusion in British Bengal from 1765 to 1912; on
 the other hand, Bihar was always considered distinct, culturally and
 administratively. More popularly the languages of Bihar were
 affiliated to Eastern Hindi, and debates continued into whether, for
 example, Bhojpuri in particular was not really very close to Awadhi.
 In the language schedule to the Indian Constitution the Bihari
 languages were included under Hindi (or Urdu). The post-colonial
 state also had a vested interest in large and consistent
 categories.  They were sometimes the same as and sometimes
 different from those employed under colonial rule; they were not
 necessarily differently constructed or more 'legitimate' or
 'indigenous'. Moreover, like administrative structures, the linguistic
 boundaries plainly generated interests. They did so
 because they were categories with intent: they existed to
 allow control and interference; and they too permitted a rhetoric of
 rights and well-being.<p>
 
 Even before and without Marx's conceptualization, hard
 categories or classes were defined according to their proper traits.
 The elements were often misrepresented or particular to
 dominant 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 15</b>] 
 
 observable fact that they need not be coterminous. Then, as has
 been widely understood, standardizations occurred through
 socio-economic activity, scientific description, literature and print;
 such linguistic orthodoxies helped create nations. Though each
 language was always plural in actuality, each could be used to unite
 as well as to divide. Ranade described the Maratha confederacy as a
 'process of nation-making', whereby people Strongly bound together
 by the common affinities of language, race, religion and literature'
 were enabled to seek 'further solidarity by a common independent
 political existence'.<a  name="rf53"></a>
 <a href="#N_58_"><sup><b>58</b></sup></a>  
The choice of 'affinities' was not accidental,
 but rather was axiomatic in the later nineteenth century. They were
 the elements of colonial analysis. As Surendranath Banerjea also
 illustrated in his autobiography, nations were built from such
 connections, or from the icons, metaphors and histories in which
 they were embedded.<p>
 
 Moreover, contests between different categories and
 ideologies reinforced the linked identifications (of language, race,
 culture, and community), and gave a legitimizing role to original
 forms. It is difficult to imagine any story of origins -- even unadorned
 genealogy -- which contains no element of explanation. But the
 authority of the 'earliest' form became ever greater, despite the
 model of dispersal and difference, because of each categories' need
 to define 'proper' characteristics and to defend possession and
 privilege. In such ways languages were delineated and ranked, and
 castes or religious communities treated as primordial races. Histories
 were devised on the basis of such assumptions, for example about
 the Aryan 'invasions' or the Dravidian 'subjugation'. Communities
 acquired and we redefined by their institutional 'memories', which
 languages in part expressed.<p>
 
 <p align=center><a name="six"><b>Vl</b></a><p>
 
  Let us now return to the idea of the peasant. First, it must
 be stressed that in its modern form it encapsulated the <i>distortions
 </i>of colonial categorization. Was it safe to assess the fortunes of
 Indian peasants on the assumption that there existed at some time a
 peasantry more or less as required by evolutionary theories? Where
 did this concept come from? It swept into fashion along various
 routes. It has been pointed out that third-world nationalists, like
 Russian Marxists and (we might add) British Indian officials, were a
 small intelligentsia facing large rural populations.<a  name="rf59"></a>
 <a href="#N_59_"><sup><b>59</b></sup></a>  Theories of the
 uniformity, distinctiveness and transformation of peasantries were
 thus to be expected. The old peasant of Europe became(as in
 Maine) the contemporary peasant of Asia -- debates about 'feudalism'
 and the 'Asiatic mode of production' still have a peculiarly prominent
 and vigorous life among Indian intellectuals -- and thus the European
 model of economic and political development could be used as a
 stick to beat the imperialists and to measure the failures of foreign
 rule. Marx had equated the fate of the working classes under
 capitalism with that of the subject peoples of contemporary empires;
 Lenin's oft-quoted picture of an emerging rural proletariat in Russia
 was inevitably a model for the fate of the poor outside Europe as
 well as within it. Thus the Indian peasant also had been subjugated
 by feudalism, oppressed and exploited by imperialism, and
 eventually 'depeasantised' by international capital. In these
 contexts the concept of a 'peasant' society was regarded as a
 liberating insight, preferred, as in Daniel Thorner's essay, to 'feudal'
 or 'primitive', and in order to distinguish a peasant mode from those
 based on slavery, capitalism or socialism.<a  name="rf60"></a>
 <a href="#N_60_"><sup><b>60</b></sup></a>  The
 evolutionary assumptions of modernism thus virtually carried the
 day. Most schools of development, whether pro-capitalist or
 anti-imperial, as well as the advocates and the historians of
 revolutions, harked back to some notion of a qualitatively different
 pre-modern 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 16</b>] 
 
 order. The scholarly
 explanations associated  peasant revolts with the spread of
 capitalism and commerce, of land and labour as saleable
 commodities, and of increasing differentiation among peasants.<p>
 
 A result of the predominant conceptualizing of the
 problem was that debates have tended to be about when the
 pre-capitalist age flourished, and how it was brought to an end,
 rather than about fundamental assumptions on the nature of
 institutions and the direction of change. Even when challenged, these
 assumptions may reassert themselves at the last. Discoveries of a
 stratified peasantry might merely transfer the supposed level of
 stagnation and passivity down the social scale; the dark. unchanging
 world of the exploited. once associated with all peasants. would
 come to be inhabited only by an underclass. What now has happened
 to the idea of the stagnant, isolated East'? Most writing about the
 eighteenth century in India has rejected the old notions of isolation
 and anarchy. But it still relies ultimately on the European model of
 modernization.<p>
 
 The Indian peasantry has been essentialised in
 accordance with what is admitted to be an ideal type.<a  name="rf61"></a>
 <a href="#N_61_"><sup><b>61</b></sup></a>  Almost
 inadvertently. we picture a scale with hunters and gatherers at one
 end, and capitalist factory-based production at the other: the one has
 little or no agriculture, clothing, artefacts, or money, while the other
 is dependent upon agricultural surplus, exchange, technology and
 mass consumption.  The peasants occupy a distinct but arguably
 anomalous position on this scale, not so much in the middle between
 the two extremes, but more or less at one end, included as a
 specific, cultivating version along with other so-called primitive or
 traditional societies. The peasants were compartmentalized, having
 little involvement with the outside world, and even then through
 their own collective institutions. This is one implication of the use of
 the word 'republic' to describe Indian villages, as in
 Charles Metcalfe's minutes on the Delhi area and in the Fifth Report
 (1812) on the East India Company. As early as James Mill's
 <i>History</i> it had become a commonplace -- 'These villages', he
 wrote, 'appear to have been not only a sort of small republic, but to
 have enjoyed to a great degree the community of goods'.<a  name="rf62"></a>
 <a href="#N_62_"><sup><b>62</b></sup></a>  Today
 we can perhaps no longer savour in full what was understood by this
 usage, in all its newness and audacity, by the classically-educated and
 in the aftermath of the French revolution.<p>
 
 But what did it amount to even then? Though some kind
 of absolute village autonomy was sometimes understood or assumed
 (as more recently in the idea of a 'moral economy' of the peasant),
 yet by Mughal times, whatever the original situation, all sorts of
 external and generalizing forces had impinged; the <i>varna</i> system was
 supposed to regulate status and occupation, and the state to own the
 land. One explanation stressed the impact of power and saw the
 peasantry as levelled down by a uniform oppression. This is at root
 an argument from value: any land whose surplus was wholly taxed
 had to be worthless as a commodity -- or so it seemed to
 nineteenth-century economists and officials -- and by the same token
 any peasantry taxed to the limit would have no room for classes
 amongst itself. But in practice such absolute oppression, without
 local agents or intermediaries, could not have existed. Above
 all, according to Marx and his sources, the village harboured a
 system of government (including allies and agents of the state) and
 various specialists, notably a 'chief inhabitant'. What kept him from
 fording it over his fellows? Allegedly it was the fact that he worked
 side by side with them, and was occupied with one and the same
 work as they were. But he was not: the chief inhabitant (he may also
 stand for a dominant clan) acted as judge, policeman and
 tax-gatherer.<p>
 
 Hence one problem with  this definition of a
 peasant society was that it imposed a sameness on India over
 time.  In the 'little  republic', originally, the inhabitants
 had no individual shares, but joint liability for dues owed to
  outsiders; and the shares and responsibilities were moreover
 divided according to principles of equity.  The potency of
 this belief was seen for example in the arguments leading up to the
 1885 Tenancy Act. Yet even its protagonists admitted that there had
 been a long decay from egalitarianism, a decay explained according
 to other theoretical principles which varied from case to case.  In the
 instance of the legal commentary on the Act, the change was
 explained by the inheritance of shares, and special roles, such as that
 of headman. The ideal type of village community
 therefore depended in logic upon an absolute isolation which had
 never existed in practice: payment of private and public dues implied
 some functionary to mediate between the community and the
 outside world, and this status would always have had the potential of
 creating difference between the members of the community. (The
 theory also of course had a peculiarly European ring, in that it
 entirely ignored caste.)In any case, it was abundantly clear, as we
 saw in Buchanan's descriptions, that the original state of village no
 longer existed in Bengal and Bihar, so that legal provisions which
 depended upon reasoning that derived from theories of origin, were
 inappropriate to nineteenth-century enactment.<p>
 
  Another problem with the notion of the peasantry was the
 similarity it supposed in conditions 
 
 [&copy;<i> Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 17</b>] 
 
 throughout India. Accounts
 based on the observation of areas of fairly marginal agriculture
 under very close political control. as in the Punjab after Sikh rule,
 described bodies of peasant proprietors which were thought to be
 relatively egalitarian; agricultural castes dominated, and communities
 seemed less sharply differentiated. at least across a broad middle
 range, than those found elsewhere. The colonial observers approved
 of this sturdy yeomanry, contrasting it with the oppressive hierarchy
 which scholars had believed from Brahman texts and informers to
 be typical of India, and with a supposedly rapacious and
 unproductive landlord class which had been set up in Bengal. But
 specific conditions of political economy had produced the Punjabi
 model, if it existed, and it could hardly be applied to the whole of
 India and beyond, where different conditions prevailed. It would not
 do at all. for example, for Bengal and Bihar; this argument. alongside
 different theoretical principles, was a stock-in-trade of the adherents
 of the 'aristocratic' social philosophy which rivalled the Punjab
 school. The argument could work two ways, as could the idea that
 'innovation' was the 'ruling vice' of British government
 in India.<a  name="rf63"></a>
 <a href="#N_63_"><sup><b>63</b></sup></a><p>
 
 In any case, the egalitarian peasantries that were
 observed -- for example in northwest India as in pre-revolutionary
 Russia -- in every particular instance lacked key characteristics of the
 ideal. The brotherhoods and smallholders of the Delhi region were
 described as fairly egalitarian but also as semi-militarised and
 property-owning. In western India (the Deccan and southern
 Maratha country), where the peasant proprietary ideal was
 assiduously cultivated by British policy, there had been and
 remained 'considerable differentiation' and hidden but 'acute'
 divisions of power over land and people.<a  name="rf64"></a>
 <a href="#N_64_"><sup><b>64</b></sup></a>  It is only <i>relative</i> 
 distinctions which have been made between north Bengal
 dominated by jotedars, west Bengal under great zamindars, and east
 Bengal with more 'egalitarian' structures.<a  name="rf65"></a>
 <a href="#N_65_"><sup><b>65</b></sup></a>  Indeed, as suggested
 earlier, in south Asia the characteristic form of social and economic
 organization, even on the margins of the highly cultivated, populous
 regions of the Gangetic plain, was of local communities containing
 principal (but 'peasant') inhabitants who mediated between
 cultivators or labourers and the external overlords to whom rent,
 cesses and labour services were commonly due.<a  name="rf66"></a>
 <a href="#N_66_"><sup><b>66</b></sup></a><p>
 
 Terminology matters because colonial policy rigorously
 and consistently promulgated a relatively undifferentiated concept of
 the peasant, one closer to more recent stereotypes. The British
 based much Indian tenancy law and many of their political and
 development policies on an assumption that there was a more or less
 homogeneous and ahistorical Indian peasantry. These
 misapprehensions had many consequences, including greater rural
 stratification. But was one result self-fulfilling -- the creation
 of peasants <i>as a class,</i> a process different from the
 regionalisation of <i>jati</i> that was also occurring?<p>
 
 <p align=center><a name="seve"><b>VII</b></a><p>
 
  Our earlier assessment of pre-colonial rural society
 implied that notions of 'peasant' characteristics, rights or solidarities,
 insofar as they have appeared in India, did require to be
 constructed -- just like all the other modern identities which have been
 analysed by scholars. Even in late nineteenth-century Bihar, Indians
 were reported typically still to emphasise their caste or ritual status
 before their occupation when identifying themselves to enumerators.
 Stevenson-Moore remarked of Champaran district: 'No person will
 state his chief means of livelihood to be other than the recognised
 occupation of his caste. Thus a very large number of Brahmins, who
 live entirely by cultivation, assert their main occupation to be that of
 a priest. Again, a barber, who lives mainly by cultivating his land,
 asserts his hereditary profession to be his chief means of livelihood.
 Conversely a <i>Koiri,</i> who has been mulcted of his land and
 lives by labouring for others, still claims to be a cultivator...'.<a  name="rf67"></a>
 <a href="#N_67_"><sup><b>67</b></sup></a>
 Stevenson-Moore's evidence was of identities apparently being
 asserted irrespective of status and of caste as immutable.  But we also
 know that very many attempts at upward mobility were already
 being made, including ones which involved a change in 'hereditary
 occupation' as well as in <i>varna</i> standing. However, for this discussion
 the real issue was raised when, to Stevenson-Moore, the Koiris, the
 'backbone of the Bihar peasantry', were determined to assert their
 status as peasants. Would they do so, in common with non-Koiris,
 even in contradistinction from Koiris who were not cultivators, and
 thus accept modern definitions of 'peasants' and 'peasant rights'?<p>
 
  Stevenson-Moore was writing of a region where agrarian
 interests were to be hotly contested, 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 18</b>] 
 
 because of indigo disputes. As
 yet, he suggested. the raiyats did not like indigo but their
 attitude remained one of 'passive acquiescence'. He attributed the
 apathy to a want of competition where villages were held entirely by
 one influential zamindar. There also may have been less need
 of contestation in a district described as having relatively sparse
 population, low rents. abundantcultivable waste, uncertain
 measurement, and few petty proprietors, and where survey disclosed
 'large excess areas in the holdings of the tenants for which no rents
 were paid'.<a  name="rf68"></a>
 <a href="#N_68_"><sup><b>68</b></sup></a>  
 But more to the point. the circumstance was that
 raiyats were 'ignorant of the value of their rights' and that 'Assistant
 Settlement Officers often had great trouble in inducing them to
 understand a question sufficiently to give an intelligent answer',
 <a  name="rf69"></a>
 <a href="#N_69_"><sup><b>69</b></sup></a>  In
 short. it may be deduced that such 'apathy' as existed was no
 necessary reflection of lack of intelligence or self-assertion; the
 problem was that the raiyats did not recognise the(Western,
 external) frame in which the questions were asked or the rights
 conceived.<p>
 
 That was to change quickly enough, not least through the
 settlement operations. These too certainly were not undisputed.
 Even in the Champaran of the 1890s there were some tenants
 thought less ignorant and less 'apathetic' than others. In two places
 raiyats already 'united to assert their rights'. On the estates of the
 Madhubani Babu (tappa Duho Suho, thana Alapur) the landlord
 claimed a rent of between 8 and 9 rupees per bigha, and the raiyats
 denied that it was more than 3 to 6. In tappa Bahas in the same
 thana, where the raiyats were more independent and better off than
 elsewhere in the district owing to the great richness of the soil, they
 were also on bad terms with their effective landlord, the Murla
 indigo factory. Together they denied holding excess area when the
 factory sued for increased rents. These protests were not futile. Most
 of the Duho Suho raiyats won their case before the settlement
 officers. The Murla raiyats also won, as no prior measurement
 could be proved.<a  name="rf70"></a>
 <a href="#N_70_"><sup><b>70</b></sup></a>  
 Was this class action, or one orchestrated by
 local leaders? It is unclear, but such collective claims. successfully
 prosecuted, may be assumed to have encouraged an awareness of
 the possibilities people now enjoyed as 'tenants', say, rather than as
 Koiris or Rajputs -- even in a situation in which high castes might
 still enjoy favourable rents.<p>    
 
 On average about one third of all
 holdings in the district were subject to fair-rent suits during
 the settlement operations of the 1890s. Mostly the outcomes
 disadvantaged tenants, but as a process the record was expected to
 stabilise rents somewhat and to 'retard the advancement of rent-rates
 enormously, and so secure to the tillers of the soil a larger share of
 the unearned increment'.<a  name="rf71"></a>
 <a href="#N_71_"><sup><b>71</b></sup></a>  
 The status of land too was contested, and
 rights of possession: for the latter there were 122 cases between
 landlords,1,298 by landlords against tenants, 217 by raiyats against
 landlords, and 572 between raiyats. In all only about 3 per cent of
 holdings were subject to dispute, but these totalled 12,432 in
 number (there were 364,659 raiyati holdings). Such statistics indicate
 a substantial, even a 'modern' involvement, of subjects with the state.
 This has significance, in a region where, for example, investigations
 revealed that there was no general custom of measuring land even at
 transfer: a new tenant accepted the <i>jama</i>, irrespective of the actual
 area of the land.<a  name="rf72"></a>
 <a href="#N_72_"><sup><b>72</b></sup></a>   
 It means that the state was promoting particular
 views of people's interests: not only introducing ways of resolving
 disputes but also, before that, defining their nature.<p>
 
 Peasant consciousness is notoriously difficult to gauge,
 but it may be assumed from peasant actions. If so, then J.A.
 Sweeney's revision report on Champaran, prepared between 1913
 and 1919,reveals a change in attitude.<a  name="rf73"></a>
 <a href="#N_73_"><sup><b>73</b></sup></a> The munsif's court at
 Motihari (covering Champaran) entertained considerable civil
 litigation between 1907 and 1917: except for 1907 with 4,763, the
 total number of cases instituted ranged between about 3,000 and
 4,000 a year, but rose to 6,033 in 1916 and 7,690 in1917, 'swollen'
 by settlement and indigo disputes.<a  name="rf74"></a>
 <a href="#N_74_"><sup><b>74</b></sup></a>  In preparing his revision,
 Sweeney found disagreements far more numerous than expected, on
 average 19 per square mile; and suits for the enhancement of rents
 affected nearly 40 per cent of all tenancies in the district.
 <a  name="rf75"></a>
 <a href="#N_75_"><sup><b>75</b></sup></a> This
 was partly because landlords and their agents were using the system
 even more vigorously than before in order to extend their power.
 But, Sweeney concluded, it was also attributable to the bad relations
 between landlords and tenants, especially in regard to indigo, dating
 from at least 1907/8. He commented on this at length. The murder
 of one factory manager arose out of an 'isolated' dispute, but also
 'there was

 a general feeling of
 uneasiness.... Continual meetings of the Muhammadan raiyats were
 held in the Sathi area under the guidance of one Shaikh Gulab. Acts
 of violence were committed on factory servants by raiyats who
 refused to labour for the factory after they had received advances
 [obliging them to do so].... Arson followed and, most significant of
 all, the sowing down of the raiyat's own crops in the...fields set aside
 for indigo....' The dispute was prosecuted through the courts, and
 with government: 'A common fund was raised for contesting cases
 and petitions were put in against the factory'. Arenas for resolving
 the argument were also provided by an official investigation and
 report, involving the Planters' Association. The remedies were
 equally generalized: they included an agreed increase in the price
 paid to the raiyats and a local bye-law reducing the area to be set
 aside for indigo cultivation. The terms of the raiyats' complaints
 themselves anticipated these procedures and bases fora solution:
 they referred to the failure of due process (damages taken for not
 growing indigo although no <i>sattas</i> or agreements had been
 executed); they alleged illegal cesses; and they claimed that
 payment was not made for labour and services.<a  name="rf76"></a>

 One 'remarkable effect of our operations', observed P.N.
 Gupta in his revision report for Saran district, was 'the large increase
 in the number of suits for arrears of rent...in every district in
 North Bihar'; the average more than doubled in Saran and
 Champaran, and 'in many villages where serious rent disputes
 existed, the raiyats combined during the process of the settlement
 operations and withheld payments of rent altogether'. 'The raiyats',
 Gupta went on, 'or the more intelligent of them, now understand
 that the [earlier1 enhancements and the methods of realising them,
 were illegal.' He regarded this as a revolution from a system...where
 the landlord kept no proper rent accounts, and issued no receipts, but
 collected as much as he could from raiyats who paid as little as they
 could, to a system where every man's rent is accurately known'.

 Friction was inevitable during such a change, but so too, surely, was
 combination, based on an appreciation of common experience and
 collective force.<p>
 
 In such a context there would seem to be an inevitability
 about peasant agitations, such as those led by Gandhi or Swami
 Vidyananda. With such experience and concepts, how
 unremarkable it is, even leaving aside economic change, that there
 emerged peasant associations or kisan sabha, complete with a
 partly-imported anti-landlord rhetoric and an armoury of tenant
 rights conceived as a proper' property' -- for peasants, and also
 defining them.<a  name="rf78"></a>
 <a href="#N_78_"><sup><b>78</b></sup></a>  
 In the twentieth century a different
 vocabulary clearly became widely available to Indians agitating for
 agrarian rights. It can be traced to official categorisations and
 policies (as well of course as to political theorists and leaders). It
 represented an available identity, though not of course an exclusive
 one, or one necessarily chosen.<a  name="rf79"></a>
 <a href="#N_79_"><sup><b>79</b></sup></a>  No doubt there were many
 means
 in the past whereby rural people tried to resist or avoid
 oppressors. But  it is uncertain that these also constituted a
 frame for a class identity or formal organization, as 'peasants' or
 'tenants'.<p>
 
 <p align=center><a name="eigh"><b>VIII</b></a><p>
 
   Colonial laws in India were devised according to
 theories of social category in which nuances and contradictions had
 no part. In their search for identities, the rulers drew on devices that
 their own history had led them to expect -- though India helped cast
 the European examples into sharper relief, as it was seen as a test for
 universal principles. Similarly the British made economic policy
 according to theories of economic development based on a false
 model of economic practice. They attempted to progress towards
 social equity by means that were not only inadequate but
 inappropriate to the task.  Such errors continue in South Asia, as in 
 Britain; indeed they are usually at one point or another deliberate 
 and self-serving on the part of the rulers and the privileged, 
 as they were in colonial India.  The consequences for India were 
 gradual (for laws and policies are not immediately effectual) but 
 ultimately serious for those unable to work the new system as it emerged. 
 Systems help decide the social and economic winners and losers, 
 encourage the formation of appropriate political interests and
 representation, and delimit what it is possible for people to
 think and the extent to which they can protest. Put another way, they
 help channel people's ideas about rights, and the identifications they
 may have around shared interests.<p>
 
 For this last reason -- and it is more explanation than
 paradox -- the colonial distortions were also elements in the
 development of a national consciousness and the independence
 movements. The emergence of the 'nation' was an aspect of changes
 in the nature of the state. What happened in many areas 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 20</b>] 
 
 of policy formed a part of a
 construction of 'India', albeit unwittingly, by the British through their
 expansion of government. The state's intervention rested upon
 concomitant definitions of its realm and all the constituents within it,
 and <i>thereby</i> could be regarded as having nationalistic
 character. First came the need to fix places and then people in space,
 and then to determine their relations one with another. Part of the
 colonial project in India took this form, insisting on settlement (the
 units being the village, estate, district and region) and then on social
 category (linguistic family, caste. religion). Management and
 improvement came together in the comprehensive surveys on which
 this account has already drawn. In eastern India they were instituted
 systematically from about the turn of the nineteenth century. They
 measured place astronomically and by triangulation, but also sought
 to identify, describe and explain it. Most of this definition took place
 in the agrarian sphere. though otherwise Western influence was
 obviously weaker there than in the towns.<p>
 
 This does not render the categorizations neutral or
 unproblematic. One problem was that encountered in any nation:
 the need to unite the classes while dividing the nationalities -- that is,
 combining all regions and sections within the putative nation. and
 separating them from others, by means of supposedly common or
 civilisational experiences and attributes. As the British government
 was quick to recognise, and as we see almost everywhere today,
 unitary typologies raise severe problems, whether applied to the
 nation or to smaller categories, such as peasants: how to
 accommodate those who, for some reason, are perceived to be
 different. Historically this problem was encountered by
 landlords,<i>patnidars</i> (under-proprietors), kulaks,
 under-raiyats, <i>bargadars</i> (share-croppers), and by Indian
 Muslims, 'tribals',  'untouchables' and so on.<p>
 
 There were two main ways of building larger categories,
 and combining elements into the nation: the unity of hegemony and
 that of plurality. In one there were dominant forms and others less
 articulated; in the other were various recognised classes and types
 which combined to make a whole. In India both possibilities were
 affected by colonial rule and its categorizations. First, there were
 civilisational norms depending on notions of science or high
 culture -- which later seemed to owe something to the anti-materialism
 advocated by Matthew Arnold,<a  name="rf80"></a>
 <a href="#N_80_"><sup><b>80</b></sup></a> but which in India initially took
 the form of an acceptance of high Brahman or Islamic orthodoxy
 and of the past. The model for such a category (or any unit large or
 small) was the vertical chain of command over <i>dissimilar</i> 
 components; it could be applied to social or political systems
 including agrarian structure. Its categories owed their internal unity
 to external dominance; they compare with other examples, for
 example those discussed by Foucault.<a  name="rf81"></a>
 <a href="#N_81_"><sup><b>81</b></sup></a>  It was a whole-society,
 organic model. At first this was merely another way of defining
 the 'traditional', the elite culture. It masqueraded, as with concepts of
 tenancy, as a careful continuation of past forms, legitimised by
 precedent, either Mughal or Hindu. It reduced the need to worry
 if recognition and privileges for one class helped it to lord over
 others. But. though supposedly 'traditional', arguably this kind of
 categorization found its most powerful vehicle in India in the
 colonial state itself, and hence led to innovation according to
 Western norms. Thus mutated it influenced concepts of regional or
 national culture and, in India as elsewhere, the definition and
 privileging of the 'native', the coining of the vernacular in language,
 tradition and mores. Nations, races and cultures are not
 homogeneous or internally consistent, they are contingent and
 syncretic in origin, and none is defined precisely by ideology in the
 way that, say, 'Buddhist', 'Islamic' or 'Christian' might be. At
 the same time the essentialisms -- 'black', 'white', 'Indian', 'Chinese',
 'English', even 'British'_do have practical meaning.<p>
 
 There remains a tension between supposedly unitary
 ethnicities and cultures, and the plurality of categories and nations.
 Thus were advanced, secondly, ideas of a unity that was achieved
 through the enhanced similarity or cohesion of constituent sets. The
 assertions of common ground <i>within</i> social classes
 contradicted the whole-society model. The preferred image of the
 nation could then be a layered pyramid of classes. The sets too were
 often presented as perpetual or given categories; but standardisations
 and improved communications -- <i>truly</i> shared experiences -- made
 assertions of their similarities gradually easier and more convincing.
 This was the project, supposedly more appropriate to India, as
 Munro's raiyatwari scheme had been before it, that was undertaken
 on behalf of 'tenants' in the Bengal Tenancy Act of l88S or for
 'agricultural castes' in the Punjab Alienation of Land Act of1900. At
 this point too the colonial state made a contribution, through actual
 and perceived standardisations, as discussed in this essay.<p>
 
 Colonial or 'modern' conceptualizations, though not
 supposed to permit such complexities, paralleled these patterns. If
 we apply the models to agrarian structure, we see that the British
 conceived of two modes of legitimacy. One concentrated on distinct
 if replicated hierarchical units (the village 
 
 [&copy;<i> Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 21</b>] 
 
 community, the zamindari
 estate, and the land revenue structure), and the other on generic
 classes(landlords. tenants. bankers). On the whole the first was
 thought to be traditional (though in fact much fostered by
 government), and the second more progressive. with classes as
 instruments for development. Both however could be regarded
 either as historically-given or as needing to be constructed in the
 interests of future well-being. This curious ambiguity was perhaps
 the result of wider imperfections in the evolution of state and society
 in nineteenth-century India. For the state may evolve in parallel with
 the creation of its people, but in India it developed ahead of the
 nation. and by hegemony rather than consensus. Ultimately the end
 was expected to be a unified people constituted in classes, indicating
 parallel processes of standardization and differentiation. But it
 would be a long time coming because India was dominated by
 categories and relations of the 'traditional' type, which were
 also gaining in strength. They would provide a powerful alibi for an
 imperialism presented as the ringmaster conserving and protecting
 irreconcilable blocs of people. This too could be regarded as
 a modern task for the state. But a deeper change was also expected
 eventually, through such measures as tenancy reform, labour law,
 and social regulation. In India (as in Britain) the move was towards
 a more wide-ranging sense of the state's role in moulding the future,
 a role mediated through classes and interests.<p>
 
 Acts of state, in defining the quality and borders of
 classes and types, gave definite rights to, and encouraged the political
 representation of, sections of society which the law itself had
  defined. In Europe, unlike India, there was a significant element
 of <i>recognition</i> in these definitions;  some
 large elements did exist from which categories were constructed. In
 some respects the changes marked an internalized standardization, an
 existing consciousness of operative classes and communities.
 The revolution in government was intended to reduce plurality even
 further. It generated neatness in procedures and conceptions. In
 Britain, France, and Japan, for example, it seemed to produce
 centralised governments and homogeneous people. Britain remains
 fairly homogeneous even while becoming avowedly 'plural', because
 of the unifying force of law, government, education, and the media.
 Even in the United States homogeneity was powerfully encouraged
 though (or possibly because) state power was relatively localised.
 This was more difficult in colonial India, with 'society stronger and
 the 'state' weaker. The British rulers were imperfect unifiers and
 centralizers, and hence flawed as state-builders.  Their categories
 were imposed upon far less standardised originals. Where the
 categories were enforced, the results included social and economic
 distortions, as with landlords, proprietary tenants, and creditors.<p>
 
 The alternative model was centralised government with a
 plural or multi-national state, as in the Soviet Union or (at least until
 the Maoist revolution) China and possibly in a future United States.
 This too was an option in India. While they created a state, with
 'modern' boundaries, goals and administration, the British also
 deliberately preserved and extended pluralities of region, language,
 religion and class (albeit mostly in larger and firmer units). Post-
 1857, their favoured units were more refined, with a growing
 recognition of differences within India, of their resilience, and of
 political advantages they might offer to the rulers. The colonial legal
 and political system, like that of India today, was on the whole
 exceptionally protective of these differences; even within the state
 apparatus itself there was(and is) a kind of institutionalized respect
 for difference. We tend to consider this a virtue, just as we regret the
 loss of Amazonian peoples under the onslaught of the prospector
 and the axe. But it is virtue with a price in terms of the effectiveness
 of the state and the mobilising of national effort.<p>
 
 Within British India, processes of standardization
 continued' while efforts were made to restrict certain exchanges
 across category. But, first, this does not mean that there were no
 'modern' types of identity. Just as large units and connections are
 formed and mobilised to constitute nations, so supposed local units
 were soon endorsed by organised local interests, once they had been
 defined in the colonial law and political system, and in colonial
 representations of culture. Importance was accorded to difference, as
 between 'Muslims' and 'Hindus', and deference shown to supposedly
 indigenous ways and norms. Second, another colonial legacy, the
 dominant kind of unit was of a 'people' (culture, language) within a
 'territory' and subject to a state and to public forms of order. The
 centralising impulses of economy, bureaucracy and law could be
 subverted but not entirely avoided. Thus new harder categories
 competed under, within and against the state, and over the
 territory.<p>
 
 <p align=center><a name="nine"><b>IX</b></a><p>
 
  According to this argument, the
 distinctiveness of popular culture, as argued by Ginzburg,<a  name="rf82"></a>
 <a href="#N_82_"><sup><b>82</b></sup></a> was
 set 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 22</b>] 
 
 against objective
 forces -- especially those discerned by many students of
 nationalism -- which were helping create the overarching solidarities of
 modern nations.<a  name="rf83"></a>
 <a href="#N_83_"><sup><b>83</b></sup></a>  
 But the general and the local (elite and popular.
 British and Indian. legal and customary. and so on) are not simple,
 exclusive opposites. Each level influenced and partially
 interpenetrated the other. In practice it was possible for mixed social
 criteria and a consciousness of class to co-exist, just as did the
 hegemonic and plural concepts of the nation. This is an argument
 against labelling any one model as 'Indian' or 'colonial', 'traditional'
 or 'modern' .<p>
 
 The ambiguity parallels the one raised by the editors of
 <i>Krsi-parasara</i> in respect of the agricultural knowledge
 presented in that text. They contrasted the 'accuracy of
 observations...tested...in the proper scientific manner' with the
 superstitious ideas' and emphasis on rites and ceremonies', a contrast
 which might (they said) 'brand the work as a priestly manual'. They
 admitted, as Pinch would agree, that 'religious practices were closely
 interwoven into the texture of life', even in 'such practical things as
 agriculture'. But, they went on. the text also contains 'valuable
 instructions' regarding agriculture. Accordingly they posed the
 question: 'in this modern age, when the world is proud of
 various scientific achievements, what material advance has been
 made...[upon] rules...laid down in remote antiquity...?' Their text,
 they claimed, should be an eye-opener to those who decry the study
 of Sanskrit as having no practical utility'. However, the point was
 not really that it provided a sufficient manual for agriculture. Rather
 it showed (they claimed) that it was 'time that we dived deep into
 this literature and rescued the indigenous materials of national
 importance from unmerited oblivion and saw the India of our own in
 the proper perspective'.<a  name="rf84"></a>
 <a href="#N_84_"><sup><b>84</b></sup></a>  
 The implication was that there is an
 indigenous knowledge which is somehow more useful or relevant or
 <i>satisfying</i> in India than the knowledge of 'science'.Like its
 recent echoes, in India (or France), this was defensive,
 anti-colonial.<p>
 
 On the other hand, one force for change in colonial India
 was a desire for the modern. and some equation if it with the
 Western or the technological -- with, say, secularism or class. Indians
 making such assumptions were faced in any number of fields by an
 apparent discontinuity, encouraged by colonial denigrations and self
 justification.. Indians had to decide between asserting or denying
 continuities with the past: many were ambivalent between two
 extremes. one which claimed a kind of universalism, a chronology
 of modern features from an ancient (often 'Hindu') past as well as or
 in preference to a Western one, and another which asserted an
 eternal national distinctiveness and superiority, institutions
 appropriate for India. Often Indians defining their identities
 emphasised particular histories and supposedly special virtues of
 Indian civilization. Of course too they built upon existing local
 frameworks of region, caste and religion.<p>
 
 These choices are obviously relevant to current
 discussions of technology transfer and re-assessments of the
 scientific revolution. The arguments of, say, Jack Goody take us in
 one of the possible directions, towards an original <i>equivalence</i> 
 of Western and Eastern forms.<a  name="rf85"></a>
 <a href="#N_85_"><sup><b>85</b></sup></a> Perhaps science
 and technology developed in India according to local patterns but
 basically in ways similar to those elsewhere -- that is, as an adjunct to
 practical technology, religious practice and so on. If so, it is plain that
 in India this knowledge did not become officially 'scientific'
 (abstracted from practical needs, governed by professional 'rules',
 taught through common syllabi, and so on) in the way that
 <i>some</i> knowledge was organised in the West from the
 seventeenth century. Even in Europe many
 discoveries were still made outside that orbit, because practical
 science and technology continued to advance in parallel with 'official
 science'. Some now argue indeed that the scientific as opposed to
 the technological revolution had relatively little to do with the rapid
 economic and industrial development of the West until the present
 century, and therefore, even if official science did not emerge in
 India, that fact would not satisfactorily explain the different patterns
 of economic development in India and in Europe. But why then did
 India not experience a scientific revolution. especially given the
 similarity of its knowledge to that of Western science (the way it was
 organised in categories, its experiential basis, and so on)? An answer
 may be extrapolated from that offered in regard to military
 technology  -- namely that India developed its own
 sophisticated forms and technologies, focused on cavalry, but these
 were ousted in the late eighteenth century by Western models based
 on disciplined infantry. In other words India was moving towards its
 own 'official science' but, because of colonialism, that 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 23</b>] 
 
 science was largely replaced
 by the version exported from Europe. (I say 'largely' because
 obviously the Indian knowledge has not been completely
 ousted -- witness the persistence of ayurvedic medicine -- and may in
 some such spheres mount a counter-challenge to Western science
 even yet.)The reason for the 'lack' of an Eastern scientific revolution
 is thereby a circular one: because the dominant revolution was
 Western, and it obscured or ignored developments of different kind
 and origin.<p>
 
 Can one not say the same of class (or indeed 'national')
 awareness? It existed in India in forms often quite comparable to
 those which were emerging in the West, but forms with their own
 character at all times, and especially in regard to what Pinch calls
 religion (not communalism). <i>Of course</i> it did not develop in
 the ways such identities developed elsewhere: the <i>sadhus</i> are
 one reason. During the colonial era some of the
 influences -- technological and economic change, industrialization.
 'modern 'rhetoric and law -- which had produced classes and nations in
 Europe <i>were</i> also felt in India. Indian versions of such
 identities appeared in response. But forms of identity -- or
 knowledge -- that appear to be the same may in fact differ markedly in
 their means, ideology and function.<a  name="rf86"></a>
 <a href="#N_86_"><sup><b>86</b></sup></a>  This allows space for an
 argument, compatible with that of Pinch, to the effect that the
 weight of Western categorisation and enumeration, and the
 institutional and economic change ushered in during colonial rule,
 suborned some but merely modified or complemented other
 'indigenous' forms. From the nineteenth century, Indian social and
 political identities then became another complex amalgam of
 different influences.<p>
 
 The pace of change was not uniform. New boundaries
 and institutions framed the alternatives indifferent ways. But they
 also shifted the balance between the three modes of deciding
 identities as expressed in ideas and behaviour: the legitimacies of
 origin, of practice, and of rationality or morality.  In Europe, origins
 were authentic because of the influence of revealed religion, of laws
 of right, precedent and statute, of a humanist emphasis on
 authorship. But everywhere, as noted already, their appeal arose out
 of conflict -- why refer to an ancient authority except by way of
 argument? The outcome implied an inherited social as well as
 historical hierarchy. This was the way of the text, whereby the word
 prescribed and tested conduct. (Many sacred texts, including Indian
 ones, contain explicit awareness of the evolution of texts, and accord
 greatest authority to the earliest version and hence to a golden age in
 the past.) Custom, the second case, gave primacy to action over
 text, and thus to agency and contingency. Conduct depended upon
 current authority and upon pragmatism, and was more loosely
 related to memory and to texts. It represented a continually
 negotiated present. But either of these first two ways allowed for an
 eternal essentialised nation.<p>
 
 The third case provided means for the interpretation of
 both text and praxis: through faith and morality or through evidence
 and reason, on the basis of either ethical or scientific rationality.
 This was the tradition of the critical textual commentary, and
 ultimately the popular mandate. It made texts and conduct multiple
 and conditional, by judging both according to independent
 principles, and thereby relying on the human rather than the divine.
 It implied civilisational rather than local or national norms.  In the
 West this method arose alongside notions of progress, as in St
 Augustine. It assumed an improveable future. But the modern era
 did not result from a movement from one of these modes to another.
 It came from changes in the means whereby each was expressed and
 perpetuated. Neither faith nor rationality ousted ancient law or
 pragmatic custom. The 'corrections' of print capitalism did not drive
 out an ever-repeated but active orality; there was no steady
 movement from multiple to singular texts, not least because texts
 remained imperfectly standardized, while custom always had limits
 to its diversity. In India part of the success of Western innovations
 may well have been their fit with Brahmanical views of
 knowledge.<p>
 
 All identities are historical in the sense of being
 cumulative and of belonging to one period and place. Stories of the
 past and of identity always contain elements of explanation and
 empiricism. The mechanisms for an ancient proof of, say, the
 existence of God and a modern one in physics are not wholly
 different, though there are other modes of explanation which may
 be peculiar to times or languages, as conventional expressions
 bearing little or no evidential or intellectual weight. At all times too
 some analyses show a preference for human agency and some do
 not; and all reflect cultural peculiarities. For that reason the 'modern'
 is partly a matter of scale and certainty. But also it may rest upon
 specificities of <i>genre</i> (though all its elements certainly did
 occur in the past): namely, self-conscious or self-referential forms of
 cumulative analysis; comparative assessment of the validity
 of sources, origins or forms; distinct and consistent measurements,
 categories, signs or representations -- at one level the familiar reliance
 on processes of evidence and observation rather than authority.<p>
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 24</b>]<p>
 
  Two points follow. First, any
 transition to such modern forms cannot be divorced from
 wider changes, such as the advent of centralised states, colonial rule,
 commoditisation or capitalism. Over recent centuries the 'modern'
 genre has dominated. and been imitated even where its rules are
 broken, because backed up by institutions -- scholarly disciplines,
 education, professions. technologies. It is this reinforcement which
 has meant that modern identities. or modern history. may be
 distinguished from earlier forms, despite the pre-existence of many
 elements of the modern and the lack of a complete break with the
 past.<a  name="rf87"></a>
 <a href="#N_87_"><sup><b>87</b></sup></a>  
 Second, a mere change of genre will not substitute real for
 artificial perceptions of history or identity. Non-rational or
 anti-historical explanations are those which ignore such rules.
 by suppressing or misreading data. They are not those with a
 particular intention or agenda, for all understandings are to some
 degree functional.<p>
 
 It may be argued that there were new discoveries of self
 among Indians in the colonial era, and that they were new <i>inter
 alla</i> because they occurred within the frame of broader,
 supposedly consistent identities. Travel, trade, language, government,
 political institutions and law all allowed Indians to encounter
 <i>similar</i> 'others', and narratives and rationalizations arose to
 account for these affinities.  Though there was nothing new in
 markers of identity, or in notions of bounded, named territories,
 yet both were now limited and reified by the more precise
 measurements and more generalised categorisations of the colonial
 era. The distinction between this latter kind of identity and other
 possible kinds paralleled that between text and custom, history and
 myth. In practice the distinctions were blurred, but there was no
 going back: the ambiguous, customary, mythic, quotidian elements
 were harnessed to the harder delineations of fixed identities. For
 Indians who asked 'who am I?' there was a new range of possible
 answers, and some earlier contingent or ambivalent replies were
 increasingly excluded. On the whole the force of change was such
 that Indians increasingly acquired their own versions of
 'modern' identities, 'modern', that is, in genre. The existence of
 exceptions or variations did not mean that Indians acquired identities
 that were 'hybrid' or incompletely modern.<p>
 
 <p align=center><a name="ten"><b>X</b></a><p>
 
  The British helped in the nationalist project in India by
 defining boundaries and classes, and by extending the concept and
 effect of a sovereign state. As they did so they also distorted
 categories of Indian society, which they allowed or encouraged to be
 redefined and mobilised. They imposed their Eurocentric designs
 upon peoples and institutions then following a different logic.  
 Habermas describes a process in Western Europe whereby 
 the extension of the state (the construction of the bourgeois public 
 sphere) helped and was helped by parallel developments in 
 society, economy, law and culture.<a  name="rf88"></a>
 <a href="#N_88_"><sup><b>88</b></sup></a> Colonial rulers in India 
 applied the assumptions and practices wrought in this development. 
 which was specific to one time and place, to a country in which 
 the ancillary changes had not occurred, could not be expected or were 
 only just beginning. The British saw India as a social construct
 according to European models, even when they closely observed its
 particular character. They saw India historically, but in versions of a
 Eurocentric history. They saw India as a bounded state with (in
 actuality or potential)its citizens, the rule of law, and civil society;
 but none of these existed in the forms supposed. Not all the colonial
 impositions were undesirable, but their impact was inevitably
 different in India and In Europe. Accordingly, there were unexpected
 and undesirable consequences even from well-meaning interventions,
 let alone from colonial exploitation or arrogance. On discovering
 these, the rulers were often led to recoil but never to abandon their
 habitual assumptions and procedures.<p>
 
 Thus the British made it possible for Indian society to be
 divided in new ways, notably by consolidations, new
 interest groups and political organization, which followed the
 agenda laid down by the state. The differences between Indians were
 not invented, but their salience and articulation
 were altered. Kisan and Hindu sabhas and the Muslim League
 were a consequence, as well as Presidency 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 25</b>] 
  
 Associations, Chambers of
 Commerce and the National Congress. Colonial rule was never so
 powerful. nor so unified and consistent. as to be able to <i>dictate</i> 
 what happened in India, except within relatively limited spheres;
 and of course there were very many important impulses and
 movements drawing on sources relatively unaffected by Western
 influence. But colonial rule did have some general features, and
 these helped to direct or limit indigenous processes, and thus to
 influence how India changed. The Indians were subject to a
 European view of their society, not just as its objects but because
 they accepted aspects of it themselves.<p>
 
 To return, finally, to the case of the peasants, the
 suggestion here is not, to address Partha Chatterjee's 
 position,<a  name="rf89"></a>
 <a href="#N_89_"><sup><b>89</b></sup></a>
 'the domain of legal-political relations constituted by the state'
 <i>had</i> to be the 'exclusive...site of peasant struggle'; it is
 certainly not to deny that alternative senses of peasant community
 (in Ranajit Guha's terms) existed or can be identified, as by William
 Pinch. It might even be to accept for the sake of argument, though it
 is very difficult to make such comparisons meaningful, that the
 Indian peasant community was more differentiated and flexible, and
 hence had greater 'strategic opportunities...in the making of alliances
 and oppositions than...the "peasant community" in
 feudal Europe'. Nonetheless, the suggestion here is that the forms
 and vocabulary of the alliances and struggles which occurred in
 modern India <i>were</i> in fact strongly influenced by the legacy
 of colonial rule: not so much by the legal-political relations that the
 state purported to 'constitute' (for it was never able to achieve what it
 proposed), but by <i>the consequences of the working of its
 categorizations upon existing and continuing relations,</i> both in
 practice and in terms of ideology and understanding.<p>
 
 The objection expressed in this paper is to the privileging
 of a supposed Indian essence, and to regarding 'popular culture' in
 India as a 'storehouse' that, in Chatterjee's words, 'preserved an
 enormously rich collection.. .of forms of popular protest', instead of
 as a <i>process</i> and a <i>negotiation</i> between various
 ever-changing influences, experienced and intellectual. My
 hypothesis is that major socio-political tendencies or transformations
 in India reflected some colonial influence, though partly channeled
 by pre-colonial inheritance. As discussed here, colonial rhetoric
 tended to emphasise supposedly primordial identities, of language,
 tribe, caste or community, but colonial policies and economic change
 also helped create classes, as through agrarian legislation or
 settlement work, or because of urbanization.<p>
 
 These alternatives -- the primordial versus the
 colonial -- arguably still define the poles of Indian political debate. My
 conclusion starts from a reassertion of the impact of colonial rule,
 but it also tries to balance that with factors of the kind discussed by
 Walter Hauser or William Pinch. As said at the outset, however, the
 falsely binary distinction between colonial and pre-colonial
 legacies is a diversion from the examination of what came to
 exist, and of what is. In considering the creation of modern South
 Asian identities, as in other matters, one needs to treat each element
 as arising from a mixture of indigenous and extraneous influences,
 and also as responding to different degrees to pre-existing practices
 or ideas and to contemporary challenges and experience. Clearly
 colonial rule provided many of the new <i>mechanisms</i> of
 identity, such as print, law and communications, but it was not
 necessarily as responsible for the <i>content</i> of what they
 purveyed. Some ideas -- for example individual rights, professional
 ethics or political self-determination, arguably the sovereign
 territorial state itself -- clearly took Western forms, because they had
 parallels but no close equivalents in Indian thought or practice,
 or because they had to be re-stated in a thoroughly new idiom. But
 the most successful  and popular elements were those which
 were palatable because they were expected and familiar while also
 meeting present needs or anxieties. This is perhaps an improved
 formulation of the proposition that Indian nationalists, in framing
 identities, inevitably focused less on public spheres of colonial
 hegemony and more on private spheres of indigenous authority.
 Thus a discrepancy in dominant notions of the proper development
 of the self necessitated Gandhi's attempt, in the concept of
 <i>swaraj,</i> to marry European notions of political freedom (an
 ability to act) with Indian ideas of self-control and renunciation
 (a withdrawal from acting). Similarly, if nationalist, conservative and
 reformist men regarded women as crucial markers of identity and
 'civilization', it was because stipulated female roles and
 behaviour matched ancient exhortations, and high-caste and Mughal
 socio-religious sanctions, <i>and</i> so-called Victorian values and
 colonial myths of masculinity, <i>and</i> recent worries about legal
 changes and middle-class or family life.<p>
 
 No particular codification or definition of public and
 private is either necessary or fixed. India developed along its own
 lines from a mixture of influences. Its line of development was
 distinctive because some influences were always more powerful and
 entrenched than others, even among the 'indigenous' inheritance. For
 example, recent evidence that the colonial period strengthened
 aspects of 
 
 [&copy;<i>Peter Robb</i>, 1997, <b>++Page 26</b>] 
 
 caste hierarchy and religious
 orthodoxy should be taken to indicate, not only the impact of
 'modern' forces and colonial misunderstandings, but also the existing
 potency of those indigenous elements even amid the more fluid and
 ambiguous practices of the past. Perhaps, by the same token, India
 was actually more disposed than Europe to encourage state
 benevolence, because of traditions of mutual gifts, duty and
 responsibility.<p>
 
 Recent demands that the Indian public should be defined
 so as to exclude special laws for groups such as the Muslims
 represent a very different approach from that favoured by the
 colonial administration, though one resting upon assumptions it
 introduced about the role and purpose of public law. Perhaps in this
 case too, despite strong ideas and customs of privacy, India has been
 able to allow public regulation to intrude into private space (by
 indigenous tracts and norms if not colonial laws) because of strong
 traditions whereby matters of food. sex. reproduction and work,
 though not in practice standardised exactly as in the texts. certainly
 had been subject to communal scrutiny and sanction, along
 lines which the texts encouraged. Again an appeal to the past, the
 authority of precedent, though quite reformulated under colonial
 influence. also may have been less easily avoided in India by those
 who needed to legitimise status and behaviour. given a prevalence of
 dualist notions and accommodations, and a relative lack of
 intellectual breaks of the kind associated with the European
 reformation, with the English, French, scientific and industrial
 revolutions, with imperial exploration and conquest, and with the
 neo-classical rejection of the 'dark' and 'middle' ages.<p>
 
 Such influences would explain distinctive features in
 India, but not because they were more 'Indian' than the reactions to
 colonial impact, as discussed in this essay. The motive force of
 national identity or development, and the 'modern' categories -- India
 or Pakistan; Hindi or Bengali: priest, peasant or worker: public or
 private -- were neither colonial nor indigenous, or rather they were
 both.  The term 'India' implies an historical and geographical entity
 defined from outside, largely from Europe. But the adoption of this
 concept <i>in</i> India was only part of the story. In constituting
 themselves as 'Indians' the people of the country were not
 merely accepting a ready-made category. Nor were they taking on a
 shell which they had emptied out and refilled with contents of their
 own devising. The category itself was always in a state of flux, even
 as the Europeans were imagining it. It contained many different
 elements, rearranged in different orders at different times, in
 reaction with India as perceived by Europeans, and with Indian
 responses. The category 'Indian' as taken on and as it exists today
 was made from some of these negotiated features, of some features
 borrowed from Europeans, and of others made and rearranged in
 accordance with indigenous priorities and understandings.  Further
 categories -- Bengali, Tamil, or for that matter Pakistani or
 Bangladeshi -- were not in the same sense imposed from outside. But
 they too were subject to similar processes in determining
 their meaning. In all cases too the meanings continue to change and
 to be advocated or contested.</td></tr></table></center>

 Eric Wolf, <i>Peasants</i> (Englewood Cliffs 1966). that essay
 developed upon earlier studies which play down exchange and
 emphasised self-sufficiency in 'peasant' production. a legacy also of
 the Aristotelean conception production-for-use. To trace the heritage
 of these ideas, see also Karl Polanyi, <i>The Great
 Transformation</i>(Boston 1957); AH. Boeke, <i>Economics and

 <a  name="N_87_">87.</a>   These arguments reconcile two opposed
 propositions:
 one, that pre-modern societies do not have 'modern' consciousness
 (and myth rather than history), or less tautologically that there <i>is
 </i>a category 'modem'; and two, that pre-modern societies do in
 fact show many modem features, or more generally that all binary
 oppositions are artificial. [<a href="#rf87">BACK</a>]<p>
 
 <a  name="N_88_">88.</a>   Habermas, <i>Public Sphere.</i> Though used. for
 example. by Partha Chatterjee (see the note following),
 thepublic/private dichotomy does not self-evidently work for India.
 In the West, Greek, Roman and Christian notions of the household
 and individual may be seen in contradistinction to the development
 of the state -- in law, politics, economic management (slavery,
 feudalism, capitalism), in humanism or romanticism, and so on. In
 India the divides have been notably blurred, perhaps from ideas of
 <i>advaita -- </i>as for caste, pre-eminently concerned not only with
 supposedly 'public' matters of work, education or socio-political
 role, but also with 'private' issues of family, household, marriage,
 birth. death. dining, menstruation -- many of these matters being
 themselves further divided as <i>kocchalpakka,</i> heating/cooling,
 left/night. and so on. The spread of the state, in both East and West,
 did involve intrusions or even extension of courtly to social
 regulation; but starting points and means were strikingly
 different. [<a href="#rf88">BACK</a>]<p>
