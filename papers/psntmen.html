<hr> 

<p>From the Kisan Sabha's own records of the 1930s to newspaper
accounts of peasant politics, and later scholarship that has
analyzed them, most descriptions of peasants have assumed they
were men. Indeed, peasant activists who were jailed, for example
in Bihar in the 1930s, were overwhelmingly male and the big
marches and protests that followed Swami Sahajand Saraswati's
lead among others were comprised largely of young male activists. 
 

<p>This paper explicates the dual implications that follow from
the fact that, 1) peasant movements were dominated by men and 2)
that historical accounts of those movements were almost
exclusively by and about male participants. However, women also
participated significantly in those movements and women's issues
were part of their ideological basis. I am not here suggesting
simplistically that scholarship has been "sexist" or that in some
anachronistic feminist way, the movements themselves were sexist.
It will be far more fruitful to develop the historical
implications of the striking fact that agrarian politics is
almost always defined in these male-oriented terms and categories
and that participants--men and women--both perceived their
politics in these terms and created histories of it in gender
segregated ways.  

<p><b>++ Page 2</b>  

<p>In addition,, the defining of peasant movements as nearly
exclusively male has had, both at the time and subsequently,
implications for ongoing political-cultural styles that survive
in the Indian electoral process after independence. The legacy is
clear in the support-roles that women have played in campaigns,
mobilizing women voters and also in the actual recruitment of
women by the political right. Significantly as well, a further
legacy has seen many women activists disdain electoral politics
entirely, choosing to create new areas for their programs and
visions.  

<p>To begin, I will address three examples of peasant issues
influenced by gender. First of all, the Bengal (later Bihar)
Tenancy Act was implemented in a way that disenfranchised women
more often than men of the same class, in large part because the
"raiyat" described in the Act was characterized in masculine
terms. Second, the position of women in society was a dominant
theme in political discussion in the 1930s from Gandhi to the All
India Women's Conference. So it is not surprising that rural
movements--here illustrated by the movement of Saini Musahar and
protests against landlord atrocities--explicitly addressed
women's roles in society. However--and critically--the way in
which women's issues were articulated to a broader audience was
from the point of view of men. And third, the separate domain of
women's participation in 1930s politics provided some women with
an equally different access to political power and political
experiences, for example, in jail or in organizational
activities. Ironically, these were often the most conservative
political movements. In addition, political movements  

<p><b>++ Page 3</b>   

<p>often manipulated inherent assumptions about gender for their
own benefit. It is these patterns, practiced in the 1930s, that
both foreshadowed and influenced the participation of women in
politics after independence.  

<p>Recognizing that the history of peasant movements as emerging
from the notion that "peasants were men" sheds light on the
structure and makeup of those movements as well as on the
definitions of both "peasants" and "agrarian politics."   

<p> <a name="beng"></a><b>PART ONE: The BTA</b>

<p> In this company, I need not spend much time defining either
the Bengal Tenancy Act, the Survey and Settlement Operations that
put it into practice, or the process defined it in local terms.
Here at this symposium we have the first scholars who used the
Village Notes, the basic records of the Survey and Settlement
Operations. However, I do intend to show that the language of the
Act and the practice of the Survey privileged male cultivators.  

<p>The Settlement Manual that shaped the Survey process charged
the Assistant Settlement Officers with carrying it out and
determining who had land rights under the Act. Specifically, they
were encouraged to record as many people as possible as Occupancy
Raiyats or potential Occupancy Raiyats. This category provided
peasants with secure rights to land after they had cultivated it
as tenants for a period of years.  

<p><b>++Page 4</b>  

<p>The Settlement took place, for example, in Darbhanga beginning
in 1896 and in Munger beginning in 1911 and in each District
evinced similar characteristics. Settlement Officers traveled
from village to village inquiring not only about the particulars
of soil and land, but also the system of land control and the
tenancy arrangements. ASOs mediated disputes between tenants
about the land and between what tenants said and what appeared in
the records of landlords. Interestingly, many ASOs favored
peasants in these disputes and accepted oral evidence, often over
the written records of the landlords.   

<p>A main criterion for establishing Occupancy Rights was whether
or not a tenant actually cultivated the land himself. If not, the
tenant was recorded as a tenure holder, something akin to a
sub-contractor for a large landlord. In the Bengal Tenancy Act,
tenure holders figured as middlemen who most exploited peasants.
By design, as was clear in the debates that produced the Act, the
BTA restricted the power of tenure holders in favor of Occupancy
Raiyats on the one hand and land owners on the other.  

<p>One interesting case that demonstrated the transformative
effect of the BTA on women peasants was recorded by an Assistant
Settlement Officer in Darbhanga who signed his name Bannerji.
Bannerji determined that Mosamat Gopi Thakurain, a woman tenant
of the Maharaja of Darbhanga, was a tenure holder rather than an
Occupancy Raiyat. According to the Village Note of Balia Belam,  

<p><b>++Page 5</b>  

<p><blockquote>One Mosamat Gopi Thakurain holds about 33 Bighas
of land in Balia [Belam] as a raiyat under the Raj. This area was
settled with her by the late Maharaja (she being a relation of
his) about 25 years ago and since then some 10 or 12 raiyats have
been cultivating these lands under her and paying her produce
rent. . . The Raj wants to have the Mosamat entered as an
[occupancy] raiyat and all these cultivators as [under] raiyats
under the Mosamat. The claim of the Raj is based on the grounds
that the lands were settled with the Mosamat regarding her as a
raiyat and that her name has all along shown in the jamabandi
[the record of land possession].
<a name="rf01"></a><a href="#N_01_"><sup>(1)</sup></a></blockquote>  

<p>Despite the landlord's written record, Bannerji proposed that
the Mosamat be recorded as a tenure holder who would receive rent
from the land and pay a portion of that rent to the Raj. Further,
Bannerji proposed that the Mosamat's current tenants on the land
be recorded as occupancy raiyats. In fact those tenants, at the
same time that Bannerji was determining the Mosamat's status, had
filed suit to convert the produce rent to rent in cash, something
only occupancy raiyats could legally do. Bannerji based his
proposal on the grounds "that the Mosamat never cultivated the
land herself."
<a name="rf02"></a><a href="#N_02_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  He also looked for evidence of temporary raiyats
hired season by season as renters or laborers, cultivating the
land for wages, to show that she had taken charge of the
cultivation. Noting that the peasants on the land had "been
settled there throughout her tenure and the Mosamat lives far
away in the village of Sopura," Bannerji decided that Mosamat
Gopi Thakurain was not a settled raiyat of the village. Further,
because of the "intimate knowledge of the cultivators about the
crops and the lands," Bannerji decided to record the cultivators
as occupancy raiyats.  

<p><b>++Page 6</b>  

<p>Implicit in his decision was Bannerji's understanding of what
an occupancy raiyat should know about the land and his strong
desire to support peasants' interests over the landlord's. He saw
the Mosamat as a tool of the Darbhanga Raj in its attempt to take
control away from the true cultivators. Consequently, not only
did Bannerji support the claims of the Mosamat's tenants to
occupancy, but he granted the new occupancy raiyats the cash
rents that they requested "at a rate comparable to neighboring
villages." <a name="rf03"></a><a href="#N_03_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  

<p>On these grounds, significantly, that an occupancy raiyat must
personally cultivate the land and know the means of cultivation,
few women were ever recorded as occupancy raiyats.
<a name="rf04"></a><a href="#N_04_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Yet many
women before the Survey and Settlement had held tenancies, like
the Mosamat's, and as a result they too were recorded as tenure
holders, not secure raiyats.
<a name="rf05"></a><a href="#N_05_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  And in 
some cases, men in similar
circumstances as the Mosamat but who knew the details of
cultivation did attain occupancy rights, having their subtenants
recorded as under raiyats. As a tenure holder, on the other hand,
the Mosamat's actions regarding the land would be governed by a
contract with the Maharaja, not by protection of law. Especially
in the Darbhanga Raj, where many tenure contracts had been given
to relatives of the Maharaja who had achieved considerable
profits or sold their rights to commercial enterprises, the ASO
viewed tenure holders as greedy interlopers on the land system.
<a name="rf06"></a><a href="#N_06_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> 

<p><b>++Page 7</b>  

<p>Most tenure holders, both inside the Raj and outside it, were
speculators. They held commercial tenures--often growing cash
crops--that could be bought and sold, and many of them became
wealthy by selling tenure contracts for profit. On the Darbhanga
Estate some of the tenure holders were British planters. In fact,
the BTA contained several sections designed to protect raiyats
from the excesses of tenure holders, who were often absentee rent
farmers without an interest in investing in local improvements.
Other tenure holders, such as indigo thikadars, used the land for
cash crops, restricting its access to raiyats.  

<p>A strong market for tenure holdings thus existed in the early
twentieth century. As a result, rent farmers and commercial
agriculturalists became wealthy not only from collecting rent,
but also from the sale of cash crops and the exchange of tenure
holdings. Tenures that were kept for yearly income only generated
the rent paid by raiyats, less the rent paid to the Darbhanga
Raj. The economics of the situation adversely affected tenants
like Mosamat Gopi Thakurain because the rent paid to her by
raiyats was fixed by the government, yet the rent she paid to the
Maharaja was assigned by the Raj. An increase in Raj rent
decreased her income. The Raj could charge her the same rent it
charged commercial tenure holders who because of their cash crop
income could afford to pay higher rates.
<a name="rf07"></a><a href="#N_07_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  
The commercial rent
farmers, therefore, drove up rent prices in the vicinity, and
many maintenance tenure holders, such as the Mosamat, were forced
to sell.
<a name="rf08"></a><a href="#N_08_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> As  

<p><b>++Page 8</b>  

<p>a result, through the settlement process Mosamat Gopi
Thakurain lost her status as an occupancy raiyat.  

<p><a name="stat"></a><b>PART TWO: The Status of Women</b>  

<p>At every level of the Freedom Movement, from village politics
to Gandhian and Congress venues, the status of women became an
issue. Ramnandan Misra, for example, who was known as a peasant
leader in Darbhanga and who organized several peasant protests
throughout the district, began his activism in an Ashram in
Majhoulia village that was dedicated to social reform. His wife,
Rajkishori Devi, against the wishes of her father-in law, left
the family home with Ramnandan and lived in the Ashram, which
held programs for women's education and encouraged women to spin
cotton and travel throughout the region fighting against parda
and illiteracy. Rajkishori became an important leader in the
social reform movement generated from the Ashram and even spent
time on Gandhi's Subramati Ashram, training as a Satyagrahi.  

<p>By the standards of the peasant movements in Darbhanga, the
Majhoulia Ashram and its upper caste/upper class residents were a
conservative force in the countryside. But because of Ramnandan's
participation among the Socialists, the peasant activists, and
the Kisan Sabha, Rajkishori Devi straddled both political worlds.
In the world of khadi and social reform women had more autonomy
and avenues for political  

<p><b>++Page 9</b>  

<p>advancement, although that remained largely confined to upper
class/caste groups.  

<p>At another level--vastly different from this Brahman dominated
movement--Saini Musahar, the leader of a movement among the
Untouchable Musahar caste, also stressed social reform and
peasant issues which dramatically effected the role of women. The
Musahar movement grew out of a series of visions that Saini had
in 1932. Prompted by these visions he sought and gained lucrative
work as a laborer in Bengal and returned to his native villages
in Purnea District to organize other Musahars to build a temple
to the Musahar Gods, Badri and Dina at a spot revealed to him by
the Gods themselves.  

<p>Critical to Saini's understanding of the Gods' plan for
improved life for the Musahars was a promise of cultivable land.
To achieve this he made passing references to Gandhi--in very
vague terms--and in much more detail he outlined a series of
social reforms among the Musahars, many of which directly
affected women.  

<p>First of all, Saini's visions often depicted evil and danger
manifested in the form of women. For example, at one point
witches attacked him, using sexual power to try to derail him
from the Gods' mission. But the main thrust of his reforms also
addressed the practices of women Musahars, who worked in the
fields alongside men. According to Saini, a woman appeared to him
in a dream:  

<p><b>++Page 10</b>  

<p><blockquote>The woman told Saeni that the Musahar husbands and
wives were committing sins by working in the same field and
cracking jokes with one another. She also told Saeni that finding
the Musahar women-folk absent from their houses at dusk when it
is time for her to visit each and every house -- Lachhmi the
goddess of wealth was annoyed and it is why she was not giving
wealth to the members of his community. The woman, therefore,
asked Saeni to preach to the community not to allow women to go
to the fields to work as day labourers. The woman further
suggested that Musahar women should be asked to keep the clothes
and belongings of the family neat and clean, to keep the
surroundings of their houses neat and clean, to bathe daily, to
burn incense daily in their houses, not to commit theft, not to
leave a village after incurred debt, to build a common Gahbar in
each village, not to accept anything less than 3 seers of grain
per day as wages, not to steal grains and grass of the employer,
to work honestly in the fields to keep the Gahbar neat and clean
and to offer worship to deities every morning in the Gahbar after
offering water to Sun God and to abstain from migrating too
frequently. In the meantime Saeni's colleagues arrived and he
woke up. It was mid-day. Saeni kept his dream to
himself.
<a name="rf09"></a><a href="#N_09_"><sup>(9)</sup></a></blockquote>  

<p>The prophesy of the Gods, granted new responsibilities to
women, both personally and religiously, and provided a minimum
wage. But born of these visions, the reforms also established
rules for separation and gender distinction that had not
previously been customary among Musahars.  

<p>Both of these examples suggest the fluidity of peasant
movements, especially where women were concerned. Agrarian
politics was not just about gaining land or establishing
permanent tenancy rights, in other words, but also about social
issues such as women's mobility and anti-parda activism in the
case of the Majhoulia Ashram or the establishment on the other
hand of more segregated relations between men and women in the
case of the Musahar movement.  

<p><b>++Page 11</b>  

<p>Furthermore, in most peasant movements in Darbhanga and
Munger, a major issue was landlord atrocities. In their oral
narratives about these movements, peasant activists often cite
the decrease in such atrocities as one of their main
accomplishments and as evidence of the success of their struggle.
Generally, outside the large estate of the Maharaja, smaller
landlords who were vying against one another for power showed
their prowess by exercising control over the peasants on their
land. Begari-- forced labor--and rape were expressions of this
control. In the Raghopur peasant movement in southern Darbhanga,
a local leader, Kedarnath Thakur, fought explicitly against such
atrocities. Participants claimed that the landlord required new
mothers to serve as wet nurses to his children and that young
women to report to him for sex on demand.  

<p>These physical threats to women certainly illustrated the
power of a landlord; but the invocation of these examples by male
peasants to illustrate the barbarity of the zamindars also
bolstered the moral authority of the peasant movements. In this
way the protection of women's bodies as claimed in the Raghopur
movement, along with protection and redefinition of their social
position as illustrated in the Majhoulia Ashram and the Musahar
movement, became integral symbols of peasant politics.  

<p><a name="reds"></a><b>PART THREE: Red Saris and Parda</b>  

<p>Although women's participation in political movements usually
remained separate from men's, women also expressed their
interests within  

<p><b>++Page 12</b>  

<p>agrarian movements. In Nawada women defied a restraining order
and transplanted paddy in a forbidden field.
<a name="rf10"></a><a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> In 
Munger in 1936,
during the Bakasht struggle in Barahiya Tal, women marched
through Barahiya Town clanging pots and pans after the men from
the surrounding villages were arrested for burning the standing
crops. The women had effectively extended the protest from the
fields into the town. But they were not arrested.  

<p>Similarly in Darbhanga, men marched on the Tinkonma field and
cut the sawai crops prematurely. When the landlord's men arrived
they found the field surrounded by women in red saris chanting
slogans and singing songs.  

<p>Even the Maharaja's own newspaper, <b><i>The Indian
Nation,</i></b> reported the event.  

<p><blockquote>A new development in the situation is the free 
distribution of red saris and <b><i>kurtis</i></b>, among a large
number of kisan women, who rushed to the scene shouting
provocative phrases.
<a name="rf11"></a><a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a></blockquote>  

<p>One participant, Ram Roop Yadav claimed that the zamindar's
agents, after allowing the peasants to cut some of the crop,
began attacking the peasants with their lathis. Within minutes
the local police arrived. The police dismissed the henchmen and
arrested the peasant men, sending the women back to their homes.
Ram Roop and his brother, Dukhi Yadav, were among those arrested.
Dukhi's wife, Sukhya Devi, had provided red saris to women who
shouted slogans and collected the fallen sawai. The women stood
at the edge of the field blocking the way of the landlord's men
on horses.  

<p><b>++Page 13</b>  <p>

<img align=right src="http://www.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/img/singerp2.jpg"></a>

In each case, women were not arrested for their actions. Their
participation was not considered a sufficient offense. It was
separate from the peasant movement, yet in a way provided a
dramatic emphasis to it. Women's participation demonstrated the
support and sacrifice of the families who were affected by their
husbands' activism and internment. Both oral narrators telling
the story and newspapers recording it, considered women's
participation ancillary. This is interesting in comparison to the
Telengana and Naxalite Movements in which women took up arms with
men. But in both those cases as well, women participants
described their participation as seeming less significant, and
they expressed frustration at being locked out of decision making
positions.
<a name="rf12"></a><a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> 
Clearly, because women peasants lacked a certain
political status, their actions were seen as neither threatening
nor significant, and therefore repressive action against them was
unnecessary.  

<p>But the advantage of such gendered attitudes by the police
aided, ironically, the famous peasant leader Suraj Narayan Singh
in his dramatic escape from the Hazaribagh jail along with
Ramnandan Mishra and Jaya Prakash Narayan on 11 August 1942. The
entire district of Darbhanga represented a "safe house" for the
fugitives, who were traveling north through Darbhanga to armed
camps in Nepal.
<a name="rf13"></a><a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  
The histories of their escape provided a
unifying narrative in the region; every village had a narrative
of its role in hiding the escapees.  

<p>Hantivali, near Jhanjharpur police station, provides an
example. Suraj Babu was said to have hidden there, sick with
fever from days on the run.  

<p><b>++Page 14</b>  

<p>Nunu Babu, an old villager whose only glory had been nursing
the great hero, told with pride how he managed to slip Suraj Babu
out of Hantivali in the cloak of night and in disguise. Nunu Babu
covered a tonga, with cloth concealing his passenger except for
the shoe tips--women's shoes. Thus disguised, they headed north
toward the border. When stopped by police, the driver claimed the
passenger was his wife, cloaked in parda. Not willing to run the
risk of offending the travelers, the police gave them passage.
<a name="rf14"></a><a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> 


<p>Gender separation and the practice of parda that Suraj Babu
exploited characterized women's participation in peasant
politics. Indeed, women saw peasant movements as an extension of
the family. The aims of the movements benefited the family and
them personally in opposition to landlord atrocities and the
demand for sufficient land for subsistence farming.  

<p><a name="conc"></a><b>CONCLUSION</b>  

<p>From the legal definition of peasants to the practice of
peasant politics the assumptions about peasants as a political
force have been largely centered on men. When peasant activists
fought for their arrested colleagues to be labeled as political
prisoners they were also implicitly referring to men alone
because, as we have seen, women peasants were rarely arrested for
protest. Women Ashramites, on the other hand, were arrested for
picketing cloth stores or blocking traffic in protest marches.
Therefore the jail court records that eventually conferred
pensions to activists and provided sources for histories of
peasant movements excluded women  

<p><b>++Page 15</b>  

<p>who had participated in peasant movements but included women
who had worked in the Ashram.  

<p>In the records of local Kisan Sabhas, for example the diary of
Panchanand Sharma, a leader of the Barahiya Tal Movement, or
Kedarnath Thakur, who organized the Raghopur Movement, lists of
Kisan activists did not include any women at all. For these
reasons Rajkishori, Sukhya Devi and others have been excluded
from the written records of agrarian politics.  

<p>Not surprisingly, perhaps, we can identify patterns of
expectations and behavior that have continued in post
independence politics as well. Within the public political system
women, until very recently, have taken secondary roles in
political parties and run for office at the bidding of male
politicians. But an entirely separate realm of women's activism
has survived as well-- largely through volunteer
organizations--reminiscent of the social service practiced in the
Majhoulia Ashram.  

<p>In political parties women have made posters and banners and
distributed campaign packets to party workers--not a far cry from
the red saris and kurtis of the Tinkonma protest.. But
interestingly it is the BJP, which affirms most explicitly
conservative values and roles for women, that has also done the
best job of recruiting them. Again, like the khadi workers, the
Mahila Manch of the BJP has all-women cadres that mobilize women
for elections.  

<p>In this way political parties continue to see women as a
separate category both for mobilizing voters and for defining
political issues.  

<p><b>++Page 16</b>  

<p>Atrocities against women continue to be issues that parties
use to gain support both of women voters and husbands who feel
the need to protect them.  

<p>While the ancillary role of women is rapidly changing with the
initiative of the 1992 amendment to the constitution for
Panchayati Raj that requires 1/3 representation for women, the
assumption of separation remains. The reservation system assumes
women's interests are different from men's and maintains a
concomitant separation for women. This year a proposed amendment
to the Constitution has been under debate to require 1/3
representation of women in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies
as well. Though it was tabled in December it may be resurrected
in the next session for renewed discussion. And all the major
political parties have given tacit support.  

<p>Proponents suggest that only through proactive legislation and
required representation of women in legislatures will women
become fully included in political debate. Their argument is
supported by the experience of peasant politics in which from the
level of British legislation women's rights were excluded and at
the level of activism women's participation left little mark in
the written record.
