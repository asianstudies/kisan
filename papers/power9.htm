Symposium</a> in Honor of Walter Hauser's 
Contributions to Peasant Studies</b></font><br>

<hr> 

<p>Mr. Ehnbom, Mr. Barnett, distinguished colleagues, and
friends.   

<p>Let me say at the very outset that I consider it an enormous
privilege to have been allotted the very pleasant though for me
formidable task of reading the keynote address to an audience 
consisting, as it does, of colleagues with large reputations. As
I endeavour to rise equal to the task,let me also say how happy
I am to be among friends and with Walter and Rosemary Hauser.  


<p>When Walter Hauser wrote his Chicago thesis, peasant studies
hardly existed, peasant movements were almost unknown to the
academy, and agrarian structures were expressed solely in the
reigning idiom of British policy or economic history. The very
face of social science history has itself changed since the
early sixties, in some cases (and it must be added not
necessarily to our advantage) entirely beyond recognition. But
the history then inaugurated abides.   

<p>While Walter Hauser's thesis on the Bihar Kisan Sabha was the
first in peasant movement histories in South Asia, the subject
had indeed been broached in writings by nationalist leaders
during the colonial period itself. Rajendra Prasad, Jawaharlal
Nehru, Mahadev Desai and tens of other nationalist leaders had
written accounts directed at the iniquities of the Indian
agrarian social order but mainly directed at the fact of British
rule.Simultaneously, in those very years of the Indian
nationalist movement,peasant movements had arisen that weakened
the symbiosis of the power of the landed elite with the
contingencies of the requirements of British rule. In a word,
peasant movements and nationalist politics pressured policy
making towards, first, modifying and then ending the era of
landlordism in colonial India. Agrarian power at Indian
Independence stood redefined. But the  

<p><b>++Page 2</b> 

<p>process of the making of the Indian nation had many
complexities of character, not the least of which was that of
the agrarian class struggle that underpinned it. But, as students
of history would know, class struggles are never simple if at
all they are, when they are, what, purportedly, they are:(i.e.)
class struggles.   

<p>Let us first consider how the history of rural political
mobilization had been written, mainly in the sixties. In one
significant area of scholarship peasant movements were seen to
have been peasant wars. Within each of the six major upheavals
of this century the middle peasantry was supposed to have played
an initially revolutionary role. The idea of evaluating the 
role of the peasantry in social revolutions came from the
political texts of the Russian and Chinese revolutions and it
made its impact in the form of the 'middle peasant theory' in
the writings of Hamza Alavi and Eric Wolf. Modifications of
this idea, whether in empirical refutation or as a qualified
redefinition, were applied to India. Usually the answers sought
were to affirm (or deny) this middle peasant thesis.   

<p>The history of peasant protest was also, following Eric
Hobsbawm, divided into 'political' and 'prepolitical'. Thus the
major question, implicit in such a treatment of the subject
proved to be: were the peasants political?If so, how did the
mobilization actually occur? This question had a longer and more
lasting impact as over the years it was modified, to assert the
case,albeit in structuralist terms, of, as it were, peasant
insurgency against the social order as a whole, of which social
order it was itself a part. To this theme we shall return.   

<p>The questions that became dated pertained to the role that
peasants played in the transformation of the social order. They
were: Which section of the  

<p><b>++Page 3</b>  

<p>peasantry played a revolutionary/reactionary role? As a
political peasantry must be led from the outside, it was also
asked: what was the nature (class origins/ideology) of this
outside agency? Was it a revolutionary movement which heralded
the consolidation of the bourgeois state (Zapata in Mexico)under
an urban leadership? Or did the peasantry serve through
rebellions to break up the existing state polity (The Russian
Revolution)? Or did the peasants provide the social basis (and an
area for tactical retreat) for a working class revolution (Cuba,
China)? Were peasant movements millenarian? Did they exhibit in
their struggles an alternative 'moral economy' (Burma, Vietnam)?
The theoretical armoury of social science scholarship on rural
political mobilization began to be reconstituted. By the nineties
the questions had indeed changed. But the anguish
remained:peasants were either tricked or bullied or led under
false pretenses into a modern world, which, given its need for
development, was (and is) heavily tilted against their interests.
Their cultures are dominated, never dominant,their futures always
at the mercy of an unrelenting progress in which town dominates
country, burghers rural folk, the bourgeoisie the peasantry.   

<p>We can neither undo the past nor alter the course of the
future in this regard. Yet, within social science concerns, we
can try and reformulate some of our questions on lines which do
not presume <b>pace </b>all social-historical scholarship a
preordained social reality To do this we restrict our reflections
to an outline of peasant movements in modern India, 1860-1950,and
examine this outline anew in light of existing scholarship. We
also try and reformulate some of the questions hitherto asked
afresh by specifying those features of agrarian society which
make more for discontinuity rather than change and which
demonstrate cultural and ideological disjunctions as 

<p><b>++Page 4</b> 

<p>opposed to presumed continuities, especially when these latter
have connoted success and failure.   

<p>Beginning at the middle of the nineteenth century, which also
corresponded with the end of the stage of direct plunder, British
policy in India increasingly became one of support for landlords
through whom the officialdom of empire sought to protect their
dominions. Every now and then there was a deviation from this
policy to accommodate the pressure generated by an unequal
agrarian society which, under the impact of the market, produced
peasant movements. Between 1860 and 1950, with the exception of
half a decade between 1930 and 1935 when prices of agricultural
produce did indeed fall, there was a rise in prices over this
entire period. The single greatest impact which such a rise in
prices produced was manifest in a developing struggle between
landlord and peasant for control over the increased value of
agricultural surplus. The landlord raised rents.Tenants
protested. The landlords asserted their proprietary rights, by
emphasizing their power to evict tenants while the latter
claimed, and were occasionally and with increasing frequency
granted, occupancy rights. Over the century, the peasants'
ability to resist landlord control of rent and produce increased
and the structure of landlordism stood considerably weakened by
the end of British rule.   

<p>It is hardly necessary to state that our preceding remarks
present an oversimplified picture of the background to the
emergence of peasant movements. Many of those peasants who won
tenancy and property rights against the landlords themselves
became rent-receivers. They rented out the land rented in (or
acquired after a struggle) from superior proprietors. Many others
became rich cultivators. Still others, and these were most
numerous,  

<p><b>++Page 5</b><p>

<img align=right src="http://www.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/img/sidiqt.jpg"><a/>

continued to lead their lives within the framework of a
landlordism which became top-heavy. While the agrarian structure
remained unequal and indeed skewed, the greater stratification of
rights in Indian rural society both within the category of
'landlord' as well as within the category of 'tenant' altered the
relationship between different agrarian social classes. In the
various peasant movements which emerged, we find that the actual
mobilization was carried out in a hundred myriad forms. Some of
these maybe reproduced as an elementary typology thus:  

<blockquote><p>1. <b>The Blue Mutiny, 1859-1862</b> <br> 

Poor peasants and small landlords opposed indigo planters in
Bengal. In this they were helped by moneylenders whose own credit
resources stood threatened by the structure of the monopsonistic
rights of the planters.  

<p>2. <b>The Pabna and Boora Uprisings, 1872-1875</b> <br> 

Rich cultivators, benefiting from the commercialization of
agriculture and producing cash crops, protested to secure further
their occupancy rights granted nominally in 1859. In this they
succeeded by 1885 when the Bengal Tenancy Act was passed.Later,
by the middle twentieth century, such tenants were transformed
into rent-receivers.  

<p>3. <b>The Mappilla Rebellions, 1836-1921</b> <br> 

Poor peasants in Malabar (Kerala) protested for security of
tenure.This was granted in 1887 and 1929. But only a rich
tenantry benefited from these movements. This tenantry itself
acquired afresh and consolidated further its rights as
rent-receivers vis-a-vis  </blockquote>

<p><b>++Page 6</b>  

<blockquote><p>the larger landlords. Peasant protest fed into the assertion
of rentier claims of one section of rural society against
another.  

<p>4. <b>The Deccan Riots, 1875</b> <br> 

Up against a heavy land revenue demand of the state,
1840-1870,cultivators lost their lands to moneylenders from the
towns. The symbiosis of peasants with rural moneylenders was
upset as the dependence of these latter on the moneylenders of
the towns developed. The protest against the structure of legal
authority which allowed such land transfer took the form of
antimoney lender riots. The state intervened to legislate in
favour of the 'agriculturists' in 1879. The state's pro-landlord
stance therefore could also become pro-peasant as long as the
framework within which it realized its land revenue did not alter
to its disadvantage.  

<p>5. <b>Punjab Agrarian Riots, 1907</b> <br>

The state intervened to prevent alienation of land from
peasants to moneylenders in 1900 but urban middle classes
protested, in nationalist idiom, against government intervention.
Riots broke out against moneylenders. The government appeared
pro-peasant, as the peasants rioted against 'agriculturalist'
moneylenders, who were landlords. Landlords we might recall were
over the long term supported by British rule.  

<p>6. <b>Peasant Movements in Oudh. 1918 - 1922</b> <br>

The peasants of eastern Uttar Pradesh defied large landlords
through a tenants movement for security of tenure. Oppressive
traditions of forced labour were attacked through fierce agrarian </blockquote>
 
<p><b>++Page 7</b> 

<blockquote><p>riots. Small landlords and the rural poor supported and led
the movement. Statutory rights of occupancy were secured in
1921.The movement marked a phase of retreat for landlordism.  

<p>7. <b>Peasant Protest against Indigo Cultivation in North
Bihar, 18601920 and Champaran. 1907-1909 and 1917-1918</b> <br> 

Moneylenders and rich peasants voiced grievances of indebted
small peasantry and agricultural labourers. Planters of indigo
were put to rout by the rural hierarchy was left undisturbed. The
movement signified the emergence of the peasant as a symbol in a
nationalist ideology.  

<p>8. <b>Agrarian Unrest in Uttar Pradesh, 1930-1932</b> <br>

When prices slumped, peasants could not pay rents to landlords
nor landlords revenue to the state. The Indian National Congress
launched a no-rent no-revenue campaign of middle and rich
peasants, supported by the rural poor, and small property
holders.The movement marked a simultaneous retreat for
landlordism and an attrition of the political domination of the
colonial state.  

<p>9. <b>Peasant Agitations in Kheda, 1917-1934 and Bardoli,
1928</b> <br>

In Bardoli a proletariat in traditional agrestic servitude
protested against an increased land revenue valuation alongside a
dominant and in relation to the 'serfs' exploitative peasant
community. The 'serfs' were partly convinced of the validity of
nationalist ideology as represented to them and were in part
coerced into joining the movement. In Kheda rich and pauperized
strata of a peasantry with shared cultural traditions and kinship
alignments agitated against higher revenue rates, resorting to
relinquishment of holdings and </blockquote>

<p><b>++Page 8 </b>

<blockquote><p>migration en masse to other neighboring regions as a form of
protest.  
 
<p>10. <b>Peasant Struggles in Bihar, 1933-1942</b> <br> 

When prices fell in 1930, the rents to which tenants had
agreed in a period of rising prices (1900-1920) became too heavy
to bear.Peasants were evicted by landlords as the latter
attempted to increase their power and control. The tenants
movement that developed sought to regain control over the lands
from which the peasants had been evicted. The popular basis of
these struggles was provided by rich and middle peasants and
occasionally poor peasants. Agricultural labourers were not even
formally included in the programme of the Peasants Association
till 1944.  

<p>11. <b>Share-croppers Agitation in Bengal, 1938-1950</b><br>

The share-croppers were mostly poor peasants with very small
holdings who fought landlords for security from eviction and
aright to at least two-thirds of the produce. The demand
originated from the government's land revenue commission of 1938
and was propagated by the Communist Party in 1946-1947.
Share-croppers were joined in their movement by small peasants
with occupancy rights, small impoverished landlords and a few
rich peasants. In legislation in 1950 and in 1978-1979 these
rights were recognized and pushed through despite landlord
opposition by various governments in Independent India.  

<p>12. <b>The Telengana Rebellion, Hyderabad, 1946-1951</b><br>

A movement involving sustained armed struggle of rich peasants
and the rural poor. The peasantry sought to destroy the political

<p><b>++Page 9</b>  

<blockquote><p>power of large landlords while the agricultural labourers
fought against forced labour. The political consequences of the
movement may be appraised at two levels. The popular unrest
provided the basis for the absorption of Hyderabad State into the
Indian Union.The communist leadership of this movement made for
electoral victories in the early 'fifties for party members from
this region.</blockquote>

<p>A glance at the preceding synopsis suggests two ideas that are
of relevance to our discussion:  
<blockquote>
<p>1. While each of the movements, and all together, may well be
said to be in some way representing anti-landlord tendencies in
the colonial agrarian society as a whole, any single one of these
movements does not exhibit any such features. Among the more
remarkable conundra of our schema, poor peasant protest has
strengthened rentier structures, anti-moneylender riots have
stood opposed to the nationalist political idiom and movements
under a communist leadership have served (however inadvertently
this may have come about; here we are not concerned with
intentions) to strengthen the domination of the rich
peasantry,and, at a remove, even the post-colonial state. 

<p>2. Leaving aside the question whether or not we can or ought
to infer any one tendency merely because all such instances of
protest 'add up' to, finally, a single development, we find
remarkable the extreme disjunction between the politics of each
episode against rentier landlordism. No leaders were ever in
common between these instances of protest; no organization except
the All-India Kisan Sabha (1936) spoke for the entire </blockquote> 

<p><b>++Page 10</b>

<blockquote><p> Indian peasantry. Even when the Kisan Sabha in Bihar or
the Communist Party in Bengal and Telengana did formulate demands
for the peasantry, demands that would have an all-India character,
the very specificity of each local variant of the agrarian
structure as well as the sheer diversity of peasant communities in
India prevented any generalized acceptance of their programme.
While, therefore, the agrarian structure did indeed consist of
unequal peasant and landlord holdings and the economy reflected a
dominant landlordism and, temporally, an emerging process in which
the stratum of richer peasantry proved ascendant, the
<b>ideological distance </b>between the ultimate act of zamindari
abolition (and other land reforms of the 'fifties) and the series
of peasant agitations over a hundred years of Britishr ule was
never bridged. Consequently, while it may be possible for us to
say that in the colonial Indian economy a backward capitalism
emerged plagued with all evils characteristic of
under-development, and in the nationalist struggle against British
rule representatives of the Indian middle classes as the
urban counterparts of the peasantry came ultimately to dominate
and even determine the politics of peasant protest, the gap
between this statement and another with which one might highlight
the cultural dimension of the mobilization process would
still remain. (A cultural dimension that would take into account
the lived and experienced little traditions of the peasantry
in simultaneity with the articulation of the agrarian class
structure and not merely presuppose the domination of such
traditions by </blockquote> 

<p><b>++Page 11</b>

<blockquote><p>'nationalist' political mobilization, notwithstanding the
number of instances one might be able to record of this
nationalist mobilization never having been, as it were,
'complete').</blockquote>

<p>In order to move towards a more credible version of the
political mobilization process we need to disaggregate our story
of peasant struggles.We might use the same sources but our focus
would have to shift towards one main aspect of the problem: an
evaluation of the cultural moorings of the leadership of the
peasantry which, we would argue, came from the ranks of the
mofussil middle classes and from <b>elements declasses</b>. This
leadership had little link, and a highly tenuous one when it did,
with the over arching spread,control and domination of the modern
state as that came to evolve, in its institutional form during
the period of British rule and in its political expression in the
decades since. Nor can its origins be defined in any simplistic
'social class' terms, given its culturally heterogeneous,
socially stratified and temporally disjunctive character. Yet, it
stood on the rural-urban continuum in its many manifestations and
while it aided the process of mobilization through its strategic
relevance to the peasantry, it simultaneously reinforced these
self-images of culture and community which served to widen the
distance between town and country and further the ideological
disarticulation of Indian political society.   

<p>The process of political mobilization among the Indian
peasantry did not,as may be expected, respond to secular formulae
of class struggle while the latter was indeed carried on and
developed in some of the forms of the social class alignments we
have just described. Instead, much of this mobilization was the
consequence of those features of Indian society which, in their
customary rooting did not share the modernity of the urban
"social contract."  

<p><b>++Page 12</b> 

<p>In this, religious belief played no small role. In Champaran
(Bihar, 1917)and northern Oudh (U.P., 1922) the sanction of
village deities was considered necessary for determining the
membership of the peasant associations and for the success of the
movement. The reluctance of those who did not wish to join in
with the peasants' protest was compared to the sin of having
violated food taboos as laid down in Hinduism and Islam (Bihar,
1917; U.P., 1921). Stories of Gandhi's non-violent success in his
South Africa campaigns, commonly told in the Champaran
movement,tapered into the regard of the laity for the ascetic and
the renouncer; indeed,Gandhi's presence in Champaran also often
led his following towards a deification of his person. The
Congress leader Sardar Vallabhai Patel invoked the message of
God, as did Gandhi, in the Bardoli (1928) campaign.The use of
religious beliefs and symbols in the mobilization process
overlapped with the social identity of the community,
strengthening thereby caste and communal identities. In U.P.
(1918-1922), Bardoli (Gujarat,1928), Bihar (1920-1935), and
Bengal (1938-1947), caste and community associations provided
many of the symbols for protest. In Malabar (1836-1921), the
Islamic religious identity of the Mappillas was a source of
cohesion among the poor peasantry and for the linking up of this
community with the urban-based sabhas of the richer Muslims.
There is no evidence in this latter experience of any rift or
tension between poor peasant protest,born of and in
identification with the Islamic community to which they belonged,
and their subservience to and acceptance of their richer,
socially dominant, counterpart. The necessity of preserving
Patidar (Gujarat, 1917-1934) and Kurmi (U.P., 1918-1920)
traditions of endogamy was emphasized as an element in
mobilization. Even Sanskritization, the cultural emulation  

<p><b>++Page 13</b>

<p>of Sanskritic practices for upward social and ritual mobility,
which confirmed the distinctions between castes, was reinforced
during popular unrest. The Bhuinhar-Brahman Sabha in Bihar
(1910-1935), Hari sabhas and Kshatriya sabhas in Bengal
(1938-1947), and the Kurmi-Kshatriya sabha in U.P. (1920-1940)
are all instances of the simultaneity of the reinforcement of
caste values and peasant mobilization. Peasants marginal to Hindu
society converted to Christianity (Sardari Larai, Chota Nagpur,
1880-1885), or Vaisnavite Hinduism, which strengthened the
purity-pollution opposition(Tana Bhagats, Chota Nagpur,
1915-1919), or to Islam (Malabar, 1870-1890).   

<p>The propensity of many a peasant movement leader to be
peripatetic, a fact hardly explicable in the simple-minded terms
of wanderlust, was a remarkable feature of political
mobilization. Baba Ramchandra of Oudh, Swami Sahajanand
Saraswati, Rahul Sanskrityayana and Yadunandan Sharma of Bihar,
Motilal Tejawat and Vijay Singh Pathik of Rajasthan, Janardan
Sharma of Gujarat and scores of others roamed the Indian
subcontinent, in and out of sects, religions, towns and villages,
schools and monasteries, but hardly ever from one peasant
movement to another. Each of such individuals experienced
multiple identity crises - the stories are too many and the space
too little for us to narrate any - as they protested against the
social process from which they had all emerged: usually one of
the pauperization of a traditional village level elite. They
looked for answers to the mysteries of life in holistic terms,
moving as they did between the world and its renunciation, often
several times in a single lifetime. Several of such leaders who
knew as many languages as they did their many worlds could be
observed in swarms, dotting the political landscape in 1921. With
its eternal  

<p><b>++Page 14</b> 

<p>fear of Bolshevism, government thought these leaders to be
'political emissaries disguised as Sadhus or Fakirs...fomenting
discontent and antagonism to government especially in Bengal,
Bihar, Assam and the United Provinces'. Moreover, they changed
their names several times, leaving behind them a trail of
aliases, designed as often to evade arrest as to escape from and
obliterate traces of their own earlier selves. It was altogether
this ubiquitous presence on the rural-urban continuum of such
individuals which allowed others, who were not itinerant
wanderers, to pose as these persons, to switch roles, as it were,
with roles discarded by others. It was this process of moving in
and out of one's self and in and out of others' selves which made
for the multiplex potential of Gandhi's message(s) which could be
transformed to suit the occasion.   

<p>Between the mercurial character of the lower level leadership
and the working out of high politics was a stratum of a 'rurban'
intelligentsia, firmly rooted in the various regions. The members
of this intelligentsia derived their livelihood from a
combination of an increasingly diminishing rental income from
small holdings and professional earnings as small town
lawyers,school teachers, lower-rung government officials, and
employees and editors of the Indian languages press. Such an
intelligentsia, though itself 'traditional' in that it did not
represent the interests of any 'fundamental' group or class,
produced a spate of mobilization literature for the peasantry
whose demands it helped to shape and whose interests it
represented in the nationalist press. The politics of this
intelligentsia, crucial as it was for the peasant masses as a
whole, was not related in the same way to peasant classes as it
was to Indian nationalism. The proliferation of regional 
vernacular papers in the 1920s and 1930s - <b>Tarun
Rajasthan</b>, <b>Gana Bani</b>, <b>Langal, Pratap,</b>

<p><b>++Page 15</b>

<p><b>Abhyudaya</b> - served more to integrate the little
traditions of the peasantry with Indian nationalism (variously
understood, variously defined) than promote the interests of any
single stratum, rich or poor, among the peasantry. The attitude
of the peasantry towards this intelligentsia was itself
ambivalent, suspicious and trusting at the same time. This
attitude lent itself very well to the subsequent exploitation of
peasant beliefs by electoral politics in Independent India but to
see in this latter process only the cynical manipulation of rural
masses by urban dominated constituencies is to miss the roots of
populism in Indian history which lay in the historically specific
character of the mobilization process as that came to be
structured over a century.   

<p>The historicity of peasant insurgency in modern India has come
full circle. The deeper sinews of community economies,
traditional moralities and customary bindings has transmuted,
through land reform and in a strange marriage with the social
contract of political democracy, into becoming a mix of casteist
movements, communal politics and class struggles. On this we have
little perspective.
