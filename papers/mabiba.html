<a name="intr"></a>This paper is offered to the Hauserfest as an effort to promote and provoke dialogue on what I consider to be Walter's central lifetime research project: what makes rural Bihar the fascinatingly and exasperatingly backward place that is?  I originally wrote the paper in the spring of 1988 for an AAS
conference organized by John Echeverri-Gent, conceiving it as the outline of a book project I then
wished to take up that would compare rural development in the three places I had studied at some
first-hand length: Bihar (since the mid-1960s), Bangladesh (since the early 1970s) and Maharashtra
(beginning in the early 1980s).  They offered a nice set of contrasts -- the relatively successful track
record in Maharashtra, particularly the sugar-growing area in the western part of the state, as against
the abysmal failures experienced in Bihar and the mostly (though not completely) bleak trajectory established by Bangladesh.  In the paper, I believe I made a good start in sorting out the most salient
aspects of the history, demography, social relations and political culture that account for the differences between these three regions.  I looked forward to exploring these patterns in my future work.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After writing the paper, however, my own research trajectory changed markedly.  Instead of
undertaking the (undoubtedly over-ambitious) broad-gauge comparative study contemplated in my
AAS paper, I wound up putting the paper aside unpublished and narrowing my focus considerably
to Bangladesh for several years.  Then in the early 1990s, I moved off in a different direction
altogether, engaging myself in the global democratization support initiative then being undertaken by
the international donor community.  The experience has been an exciting one, but a part of the
opportunity cost has been an almost total neglect of the subcontinental research that attracted me for
so long.  The 1997 Hauserfest offers an excellent opportunity to rekindle that interest, and to assess
whether the distinctions that seemed so important in 1988 still do almost a decade later.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A quick glance at the three regions finds the political climate considerably changed, to say the least. 
After four decades and more under uninterrupted Congress rule, Maharashtra has taken a lurch to
the Hindu right with its Bharatiya Janata Party/Shiv Sena government.   In Bihar the rise of the
backwards that didn't quite get established in the Karpoori Thakur era has now achieved an
ascendancy in Laloo Prasad Yadav's ministry.  And in Bangladesh, the Ershad dictatorship of the
1980s has given way to a parliamentary democracy.   At other levels, though, things do not seem so
different.  Western Maharashtra's sugar belt continues (I think) its relative prosperity.  In Bihar the
Rs 950 crore fodder scam currently swirling around Laloo Prasad Yadav seems strikingly reminiscent
of the huge fertilizer scandal that beleaguered Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra in the 1980s, both in
its scope and in the strong probability that Laloo's political fortunes will be not be harmed any more
by the scandal itself than Jagannath Mishra's were in his time.  And in Bangladesh, the principal defect
in the political system -- the inability of the parties to accept even the most basic operating rules of
comity -- continues to threaten fundamentally the basic stability of the polity.

<p>I should also mention that the foreign assistance picture has changed quite radically since the mid-1980s.  At that time budgets were relatively large, and policy expediency in pursuit of Cold War
objectives often gave dictators precedence over democracy in donor calculations.  Today budgets
have become much reduced, while support for democracy has attained a priority close (and maybe
even equivalent) to that accorded to markets.  It is difficult, in a word, to imagine foreign aid any
longer assuming the role it played in 
<a
href="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/img/mfigure1.html">
Figure 1</a>.

<p>But that is all by the way.  The main issue that I hope the paper will lead the Hauserfesters to consider
is this: does it still make sense (assuming that it did at least to some extent in 1988) to look at these
three areas of the subcontinent in the ways I have suggested, or has the situation changed enough to
demand new analytical lenses and perspectives?  And if so, what new approaches to comparative
analysis can be offered?

<p>I am very much looking forward to our gathering later on in May.  See you all then.

<i>
<p>This paper represents an outline of thoughts that have taken about fifteen years to put together on
rural development in several parts of the Indian subcontinent.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  
It is thus more the skeleton of a book-length analysis than a complete presentation in itself.  I offer 
the outline in hopes of receiving
comment and criticism that will be useful in turning it into the much longer treatment that the topic
deserves.

<p>What I am basically trying to do here is rough out a set of ideas as to why rural development has 
been more or less successful in Western India, while it has unquestionably been as yet a failure 
in most of the eastern part of the subcontinent.  Specifically, I wish to concentrate on 
Maharashtra and within it on the area known as Western Maharashtra as a relative 
success story, though the concepts to be sketched out here in many ways apply 
to Maharashtra as a whole and within broad limits to Gujarat as well.  As cases 
of failure in rural development my focus will be on Bihar and Bangladesh, though
much of the reasoning would apply with equal force to Eastern Uttar Pradesh 
and Madhya Pradesh (and in very broad terms West Bengal fits in too, though 
its rather different history in recent decades has put a distinct spin on things 
there, so much so that I will not include it in the present analysis).  Between the 
two cases of failed development, Bihar is clearly the more intractable, though perhaps
not absolutely and hopelessly so, while in Bangladesh the scope for silver linings to the dark clouds
of reality is somewhat greater.

<p>The object of the exercise here is partly to seek and build an understanding of the wider patterns of
development in rural South Asia, as any worthwhile effort in social science should do, but my motives
also go beyond that level to search for policy options.  To be blunt about the enterprise, I wish to ask: 
are there any lessons in the experience of Maharashtra that would be valuable in formulating rural
development policy for the eastern portion of the subcontinent?  And to anticipate my answer,  I
believe there are some answers in the Maharashtra experience, albeit tentative ones and ones that will
at best take a fairly long time (at least as policy makers think of time) to bear fruit.  There are indeed
some useful things to be learned.

<p>At this point, I should lay out my credentials and lack of them for the task at hand.  I first tried to
fathom Bihar  in my dissertation research during 1966-67, in an election study that was essentially
political anthropology.  Not until the early 1970s did I become concerned with rural development,
when I had a chance to do a field study in Bangladesh. Since then I have returned to both Bihar and
Bangladesh a number of times, and while I do not know either with the grasp and depth of specialists
like Walter Hauser and Pradhan Prasad on Bihar, or Peter Bertocci and Rounaq Jahan on Bangladesh,
I am for the most part comfortable with the two regions.  In working on rural Maharashtra, however,
I am a relative tyro, having been there the first time only in 1982 and that merely for a couple of
months.  Two more recent visits have helped, as well as a good deal of reading, but I remain clearly
an academic <em>arriviste</em> in the Deccan of Western India.  Still, I hope that I have picked up enough to
gain some insights into what has been going on there and why things happen as well.

<p>And last, before getting on with things, a few definitions and terms are in order.  "Rural development"
is used here in a fairly wide sense; it encompasses economic growth and distributional equity (across
lines of class, ethnicity and sex) in the countryside, as well as advances in such "life quality" measures
as literacy, infant mortality and life expectancy.  Political and institutional development are also a part
of rural development, but more as means than as ends.  In particular, popular participation in
decision-making, which some would see as a worthwhile end in itself (a view with which I would not
disagree), is  treated here as instrumental to such ends as better public health or social welfare.   As
a shorthand, I shall refer to Western Maharashtra as WM, and to Bihar/Bangladesh as BB.</i>

<center><strong><a name="poli">I. The Political Economy of Rural 
Development in Bihar and Bangladesh</a></strong></center><p>

The dynamic presented in 
<a
href="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/img/mfigure1.html">
Figure 1</a> is a depressingly familiar one to anyone who has worked in the
eastern part of the subcontinent, whether as an academic researcher or a rural development
practitioner.  Its only redeeming virtue is an elegant simplicity which makes it dismayingly easy to lay
out in a few words.  There are three groups of significance here in this semifeudal<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> rural political
economy, connected together by an age-old binding of patronage, support and exploitation.  The first
level is the state , which lies uneasily at the apex of the structure, concerned principally to maintain
itself in power.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  Its primary objective with respect to the countryside is to assure a relative peace and
to prevent serious disorder from breaking out (previously, an additional objective was to extract
rents, but this revenue function has attenuated virtually to the vanishing point in recent decades).  The
state attains this goal by forming and keeping a <em>de facto</em> alliance with village-level landowning elites,
whereby government guarantees property rights (despite periodic rhetorical gasconades fired off
promising land reform) and provides patronage in the form of rural development program spending,
in return for which rural elites keep local order and support the regime. 

<p>Village elites in their turn exercise a control over the lower orders through the customary machineries
of patron-client relationships, money-lending, sharecropping, wage labor, dominance over institutions
of local self-government, and of course the traditional <em>goondas</em> and <em>lathials</em> kept on retainer to
enforce elite authority.   The objects of these attentions are of course the remainder of the village
population, the small and marginal farmers, the artisan families and those who are without either land
or traditional craft skills, i.e., the landless agricultural workers and their families, who form the
residual occupational category for those who cannot find employment elsewhere.  In return for the
subsistence that is provided to them and in consequence of the control that is exercised over them,
these village poor and landless work for their patrons and provide support to them by accepting the
<em>status quo</em> in the countryside.   At times, things wear too thin and protest breaks out of a magnitude
that cannot be easily  subdued by the village thugs; on these occasions, the state sends in sufficient
armed constabulary to subdue whatever trouble has arisen.  But such outbreaks are relatively rare and
isolated, such that the usual systems of control generally suffice to keep things in order.

<p>Whatever resources come into this system, whether from foreign donors or the central government's
development budget, fit easily into it and even reinforce it.   Thus projects intended to provide
agricultural credit or furnish irrigation equipment or set up small-scale rural industries become
perverted to funnel funds into the hands of local elites.  But this pattern of rural development
perversion should not, as Keith Griffin among others has pointed out,  be viewed as "failure", but
rather should be seen as evidence of a successful attempt to maintain the countryside as it is.  The
overall rural economy, then,  is an impressively homeostatic structure, into which an independence
movement can come, political parties can flourish (even competitively for much of the time), a
<em>zamindari</em> system can be abolished, sizeable infusions of development funding can be poured, hordes
of development administration personnel can be deployed, and a "Green Revolution" in agricultural
technology can be introduced, all without producing more than ephemeral change. 

<p>That all these developments have served primarily to reinforce an enduring reality can be explained
in large part by the overall orientation of the landed class, which is essentially to preserve its position,
to maintain control  over the lower orders, rather than to maximize income or wealth.  For their part,
the rural poor find that their most pressing need in an environment of steadily increasing pressure on
the land and surplus labor eking out a living from that land is simple survival.  If acceptance of elite
dominance is the price to be paid for survival, then the bargain is not a bad one, and in any event, the
alternative is most likely not to survive.

<p>The picture presented here is to be sure a greatly simplified one.  There are other classes or strata in
the countryside beside elites and the poor.  One significant group here is a "middle farmer" segment
of the peasantry that is attracted by the prospect of increasing income through raising productivity,
thereby offering a way out of the semi-feudal economy.  This is the heart of the middle caste Lok Dal
constituency that a decade ago seemed on the verge of consolidating a breakthrough in Bihar, but
which has since succumbed to a restoration of high caste, large farmer control (in Bangladesh there
has not as yet appeared any political party to champion the interests of this stratum, though the
"progressive farmer" spirit certainly does exist to some extent).   And there has been in recent years
a pattern of increasing unrest at the bottom of the class/caste spectrum, particularly in Bihar, which
has seen a growing activism among landless Harijans, along with the most brutal repression of their
cheekiness at the hands of rural elites and the police establishment acting in the interests of those
elites.  There is also some evidence, admittedly skimpy for the most part, of rural development efforts
achieving a modest success.  A new bridge across the Ganges at Patna, for instance,  has connected
a large swath of previously isolated North Bihar with the larger economy and is bringing a more rapid
economic growth to the area. In Bangladesh, fertilizer use has grown substantially over the last fifteen
years.  Rural electrification has made some progress in both areas.

<p>But these qualifications are comparatively minor, indicative perhaps of social transformations slowly
and even glacially emerging, but as yet such changes are but small currents and isolated eddies set in
a huge and essentially stagnant backwater.  <em>Plus &ccedil;a change, plus c'est la m&ecirc;me chose</em> remains the
basic all-purpose aphorism for the region.

<p>The institutions and linkages portrayed in 
<a
href="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/img/mfigure2.html">
Figure 2</a> apply to Ahmednagar District, which might be said
to be the central or core region of the Maharashtrian Deccan, but <em>mutatis mutandis</em> the analysis here
would apply to the  remainder of Western Maharashtra as well and, in a somewhat modified fashion,
to the state as a whole.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 

<p>The first thing to note is that the structures of 
<a
href="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/img/mfigure1.html">
Figure 1</a/> are also present in 
<a
href="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/img/mfigure2.html">
Figure 2</a>.  Village level
elites (here labeled "big and middle farmer," noted as A in the figure) and the rural poor and landless
(B) are still there, as is the state government, though the latter is renamed "Representative political
system (D)," for reasons which will become apparent as the discussion proceeds.  But there are a
good number of other institutions present as well.  In a paper of this scope (which is already
threatening to become too long), it will not be possible to examine each of these institutions, but I
will endeavor to point out the salient features of the system. 

<p>What is important here is not only the institutions themselves, but also the linkages connecting them
together.  Both aspects are far more highly developed in WM than in BB.  In general terms, the
institutions of WM are also present in BB, but in the former case, they have become functionally
specific, in the Parsonian sense, such that they can and do perform the tasks which they are nominally
assigned, whereas in BB the rural political economy virtually ensures that whatever the formal
purpose of an institution, its true function is simply to grease the machinery supporting the status quo. 
Thus development projects like the Mula irrigation scheme in WM (J in 
<a
href="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/img/mfigure2.html">
Figure 2</a>) do in fact provide
water to farmers in timely fashion, sugar cooperatives (E) have become immensely powerful engines
of rural development, and the Employment Guarantee Scheme (K) has established a welfare "floor"
which guarantees a wage to everyone in the rural areas of the state. 

<p>Several features of 
<a
href="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/img/mfigure2.html">
Figure 2</a> deserve mention, even in a treatment as brief as this one.  The <em>sugar cooperatives</em> are an outstanding success story in the annals of rural development.  Begun in the early
1950s, they now process the overwhelming majority of a steadily increasing sugar crop in the state,
provide immense direct benefits to their members, and exercise a large (some would say inordinate)
influence in the state as a whole.  Various reasons can be cited for their success, perhaps chief among
them the several peculiarities of sugar cane production which make it relatively easy for cooperatives
to maintain a close linkage to their growers.  To begin with, sugar is a crop that, unlike foodgrains,
needs processing before it can be used by consumers.  Some variations on that processing can be
fairly rudimentary, such as <em>gur</em> (crude brown sugar) making, which consists essentially of squeezing
the juice from the cane and boiling it down in large vats.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  But the major demand these days is for
refined white sugar which sells at a considerably higher price.  Refining is a highly sophisticated
technology, necessitating a very large outlay in terms of investment.  The point here is that before
sugar  can be sold to consumers, it must be processed.

<p>It is this need for processing that gives the cooperative its leverage, for growers find they have to sell
(at least most of) their crop to the cooperative, and when they deliver it, the cooperative can deduct
from the price the cost of whatever loans have been made.  There is in other words a built-in
mechanism for recovering loans, a feature which allows the coop to remain solvent, thereby avoiding
the problems of loan default that have so devastated coops elsewhere.  A second quality of sugar here
is that it is highly perishable.  After cutting, the cane begins immediately to lose its sucrose content;
it "spoils as rapidly as milk," in the local aphorism.  Accordingly, long storage to wait for a price rise
or transport to distant processors who might offer a better price is just not feasible.  And third, sugar
is an extremely thirsty crop; its need for water is far in excess of any other crop grown in the region,
which means in semi-arid WM that sugar is dependent on reliable irrigation. 

<p>But these are far from the only reasons for sugar's success.  In addition to these factors of crop
production and processing technology, there has been a very strong connection to the <em>political sector</em>
(D in 
<a
href="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/img/mfigure2.html">
Figure 2</a>) in the form of massive subsidies bestowed on the sugar cooperatives.  These subsidies
come in several forms.  First, the state government has provided large-scale loans to sugar
cooperatives to help them raise the sizeable start-up capital required.  Second, the water supplied
through the various irrigation schemes has been priced to farmers at a fraction of its true cost.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  Third,
electricity used to lift water for sugar has been heavily underwritten by the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  And last, government has provided cane price supports that mean the domestic
price of sugar in India has been a multiple of several times the world price.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>  Thus water has been a
massively subsidized input provided by state at high cost, to be wastefully used in growing and
processing a crop to be sold at a very handsome price and profit in lieu of what would be a rather
cheap imported commodity. 

<p>The mechanism involved in securing this bounty to the cooperative sugar sector has been one that
would be very familiar indeed to North Americans or Europeans.  Simply put, the cooperatives have
used a portion of their profits to back candidates for political office, and have then put pressure on
those elected to obtain and maintain massive subsidies to sugar.  The story sounds strikingly like the 
saga of Louisiana cane sugar and western beet sugar growers in the United States, who have also
been able through political pressure to push the domestic price of sugar in the United States up to
three or four times world levels.

<p>The <em>Employment Guarantee Scheme</em> (K in 
<a
href="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/img/mfigure2.html">
Figure 2</a>, known throughout the state by its English acronym, EGS) is another remarkable institution in Maharashtra.  In effect for almost fifteen years, it
virtually assures a daily job in unskilled labor at minimum wage to anyone in the rural areas of the
state who asks for one, subject to the stipulations that there can be no unmet demand for agricultural
labor in the area and that the wages paid by EGS may not be higher than those prevailing in the local
agricultural sector.  In the early 1980s, EGS provided annually about 150 million person-days of
work, at a cost of about Rs 140 crores (US $115 million) a year.  There are a number of problems
with the program, to be sure.  Much of the rural works constructed, for instance, turn out to be land
improvements such as bunding and leveling on land belonging to richer rural households, rather than
community assets.  Second, in some areas (particularly the drought-prone districts of WM), officials
are running out of projects that can be taken up through EGS:  just about all the work that could be
done has been done, leaving less and less for future years.  Third, the EGS itself can be seen in a
cynical light as a device perpetrated by urban elites (C in 
<a
href="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/img/mfigure2.html">
Figure 2</a>) for keeping rural hordes in the
countryside by bribing them to stay out of Bombay (it is funded mainly through a combination of
urban professional taxes, sales taxes and general state revenues, most of which come from Bombay). 
And last, there is considerable political pressure on officials to employ the program to nurse their
constituencies.  But the long and short of it is that the EGS has built a rural social safety  net that
does not exist in like form anywhere else in the country.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 

<p>It is of course true that similar institutions exist in BB.  There are cooperatives, representative
political institutions, and rural works schemes in both regions.  But in this more easterly environment,
rather than to raise agricultural production, the entire cooperative structure serves mainly to channel
state funds into the hands of rural elites by allowing and even encouraging them to take over
cooperative units, steer the loan monies to themselves, and then default on their overdues. 
Institutions of local and state government are dominated by these same elites, who are thereby aiding
and abetting themselves in perverting the cooperative structure, while doing nothing for the rural poor
and landless.  Likewise, programs specifically aimed at such groups, like rural works schemes,  are
also swept into the politics of patronage and corruption, yielding little but further rewards for the
rural rich. 

<p>Needless to say, I have exaggerated the picture somewhat here. It would be hard to find many
successful coops in BB, but there is some evidence that the political system is having to pay some
attention to the middle class/caste farmers in Bihar that formed the backbone of the Lok Dal, if only
by buying their allegiance to the Congress Party.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  In Bangladesh, the Rural Works Programme that
began under Ayub Khan in the early 1960s was a case study in all the abuses outlined above, but there
are other efforts that have been better managed, such as the current CARE Food for Work program,
which is currently generating some 20 million days of work annually in Bangladesh and is a model
of development administration.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> 

<p>But the overall tenor of the rural development experience in WM and BB could scarcely be more
different.  In WM there is some corruption and considerable public waste offset against a pattern of
steady and significant rural development that has had a real effect in raising income and living
standards across the entire spectrum.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>  In BB on the other hand, there is some indication of
development here and there, perhaps, but the overall pattern has been one of stagnation and decay. 
The question, then, is <em>why</em> should things be so different in the two regions?  It is to this issue that the
discussion turns in the next section.

<p><center><strong><a name="expl">III.  Explanations:  Why Are the Two Regions So Different?</a></strong></center>

<p>The argument so far has been reasonably straightforward.  The details remain to be filled in and
fleshed out, but the evidence for development in WM and stagnation in BB is so abundant that there
should be relatively few difficulties in doing so.  Explanations of these glaring differences are of
course more problematic, but then good social science should explain, as well as portray.  Moreover, 
as I  mentioned in the opening paragraphs to this essay, I do have a policy recommendation agenda,
and a good understanding of the reasons behind  the differences between the two areas is a necessary
prerequisite to such an endeavor. 

<p>As might be expected with anything so complex as success and failure in rural development over the
past four decades, possible explanations abound.  For convenience, they are grouped here in terms
of history, demography, socio-economic and cultural dimensions, and political style, an ordering
which in a very loose sense constitutes a spectrum between what is more causal and what is more
consequential. 

<p><strong><a name="hist">History</a></strong>

<p>1.  <em>Land tenure systems</em>.  The basic outlines of the differences between the ryotwari and zamindari
systems of land revenue and tenure are sufficiently well known that I need not spend time on them
here.  Their consequences are also well appreciated by those who have worked in the vineyard of the
subcontinent's rural economy. In many, many ways the former zamindari areas of India and
Bangladesh still labor under the historical weight of a system that discouraged husbandry and land
improvement among the peasantry while rewarding indolence and parasitism among the landlord
class.  On the other hand the relatively freehold tenure enjoyed by the peasantry of the Bombay
Presidency in the British period gave it a head start as a class producing independently for a market. 
For the former, the  feudal/semifeudal concerns of status and control were paramount, while for the
latter, landowners were more concerned with maximizing income.

<p>2.  <em>Urban-rural linkages</em>.  The mofussil of the Bengal Presidency constituted a hinterland supporting
with its rents a cosmopolitan elite in Calcutta, whereas the rural areas of Bombay Presidency, though
in many ways a hinterland to Bombay city, did have a cultural self-sufficiency and self-identity with
centers of culture and economic dynamism like Pune, Ahmedabad and Vadodara that were lacking
in the Bengal hinterland, where Dhaka, Patna, Cuttack, etc., were just not on a plane with the western
towns.  When the various segments of territory from the Bombay Presidency, Central Provinces,
Hyderabad and a wide scattering of smaller princely states all joined together in the states
reorganization of the 1950s to make up the Maharashtra state that emerged in 1960, Nagpur and 
Aurangabad replaced the Ahmedabad and Vadodara that disappeared with the creation of Gujarat
state.  In sum, Maharashtra developed a relatively integrated regional culture and economy.

<p>In BB, on the other hand, an urban regional infrastructure did not develop after the 1912 splitting off
of Bihar and Orissa.  The new province continued to be dominated by Calcutta down through the
partition in 1947. Even today, Bihar has nothing like a developed urban regional economy, as is clear
in Table 1, where it will be observed that this state of almost 70 million cannot support a single city
(Patna) with over one million in size.  And in fact the cities ranked second (Dhanbad), third
(Jamshedpur) and fourth (Ranchi) all are industrial towns connected primarily to Calcutta and having
little to do with the rest of Bihar outside the Chotanagpur industrial belt.  Thus in terms of the socio-economic-political-cultural entity that is Gangetic Bihar, an area of some 56 million people in 1981,
the second largest municipality was Gaya, which at that time had fewer than 250,000 souls.  For
Bangladesh, the story was one of even less urbanization, as East Pakistan became cut off from its
Calcutta metropolis in 1947, leaving the new province of 40 million people with its capital Dhaka
having a mere 200,000 inhabitants.  Even by 1961 Dhaka still had less than 600,000 people, though
its growth as the capital of independent Bangladesh has been quite rapid indeed, so that by 1981 it
boasted almost 3.5 million people.  The drop-off in the rank-size listing in Table 1 remains
remarkable, however.  After the first two cities Dhaka and Chittagong), number three (Khulna) has
only 620,000 and the fourth highest is less than 200,000.  In other words, Dhaka gives some (albeit
mixed) evidence of becoming to Bangladesh what Calcutta had earlier been to greater Bengal -- a
parasitic city that both drains the countryside and in the process prevents other cities from becoming
more than overgrown villages.

<p>In these respective processes of urban growth and non-growth, the linkages that tie city to
countryside progressed quite differently in the two areas.  Calcuttta had (and to some extent Patna
still has, though by now in Dhaka the situation is rather different, I believe) an essentially exploitative
relationship to its <em>mofussil</em>, extracting rural rents to maintain a sophisticated urban lifestyle.  Bombay,
Nagpur and Pune are scarcely innocent of exploiting their hinterlands, but in the bargain they provide
an array of developmental assistance (state services, finance, trade, etc.) that has actually promoted
economic growth in the countryside.

<p>3.  <em>Martial history</em>.  WM was the base of Shivaji's operations in the 17th century, when the Maratha
Confederacy began to push out the Mughal Empire and then gave a fair challenge to the East India
Company for dominance of western India.  There is thus a legacy of martial success and self-assertion
in WM that contrasts markedly with the experience of BB, which has been under the sway of
"foreign"  (though some of them indigenized themselves quite well) rulers for the last thousand years
or so.  One obvious manifestation of this is the equestrian statues of Shivaji that one sees all over WM
(almost always in a traffic circle fenced in by wickets shaped like military shields with crossed spears),
proclaiming the martial legacy of the citizenry.  Self-assertion vs subjugation by foreigners is the
theme here.

<p> <strong><a name="demo">Demography</a></strong>

<p>The social makeup of WM has one clearly dominant caste, while in Bihar there are several large and
powerful caste groups all contending for dominance.  The Marathas  constitute about 35% of total
population in Maharashtra (people commonly say 40%, but as best as I can tell from the 1931
census<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> it seems to be about 35%, assuming population growth <em>pari passu</em> among all the state's
communities).  The next largest group are the Mahars, a Scheduled Caste community with about 10%
of the population.  They do have some political clout (the Nava Buddhist movement and the Dalit
Panthers, for instance, are mainly Mahar in their leadership and composition, I think), but they are
not in any serious way rivals to the Marathas for dominance.  The result is that Marathas determine
the political leadership of the state. They do have factions among themselves, to be sure, but this is
not enough to allow other groups to move into control.  Even when a non-Maratha has been in
charge, e.g., V. P. Naik as chief minister in the 1960s, his sitting on the <em>gaddi</em> was possible only
because a substantial segment of Marathas agreed to it.

<p>In Bihar the largest Hindu community has about 11% of total population (again making the same
assumptions on growth of different groups at the same pace since the 1931 census) -- the middle
("backward" in the Bihar lexicon) caste Yadavas.  Then there are three upper caste ("forward")
communities in contention (Brahmans at 5%, Bhumihars at 3% and Rajputs at 4%), as well as two
other "backward" caste groups (Kurmis and Koiris, both at 4%).   The consequence in Bihar is that
since the first Congress government in the late 1930s there has been intense caste rivalry over gaining
control of the state's politics.  It is not indulging in hyperbole to say that an incredible amount of time
and energy has been and continues to be squandered on fights for caste dominance in the state's
political system, leaving very little of either available for leading serious development efforts.

<p>Bangladesh of course is 90% Muslim and so caste conflict is really not an issue there.  The implication
is  an interesting one.  Insofar as Bihar and Bangladesh are similar cases, and given that caste conflict
is not present in the latter, then that same caste conflict cannot explain more than a part of the
developmental backwardness of the former.  Obviously, of course, the two are not the same and so
caste can carry some of the explanatory freight for one of them, but the similarities in most other
respects of their histories, cultures and economies are so striking that the explanations of their
backwardness must be similar in many ways as well.


<p><strong><a name="soci">Social Relations</a></strong>

<p>1.  <em>Interpersonal relations</em> are generally less harsh in WM than in BB. In a palpable sense, people are
nicer to each other.  This manifests itself in all sorts of ways.  For one thing, the <em>superior/subordinate
relationship</em> in BB is characterized by arbitrary arrogance from above and a fawning sycophancy from
below--the "<em>ji huzoor</em>" mentality pervades all hierarchical organizations.  While WM is scarcely
egalitarian, the relations between higher and lower status levels seems significantly less rigid and
exploitative.  Secondly, <em>social behavior</em> is more public-regarding.  People in BB hardly ever stand
in queues in public places like bus stops and post offices, they have virtually no civic consciousness
in throwing out refuse, they drive and park vehicles with no regard to convenience of pedestrians.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> 
In WM people are much more socially conscious on all these counts.

<p>2.  The <em>status of women</em> is much higher in WM. Women are more conspicuous in public and less restricted in habits of dress and movement.  The whole milieu of <em>purdah</em>, which is so pervasive in BB
is hard to discern in WM. In Pune women wearing dresses are so common as to be ordinary, while
in Bihar and Bangladesh dresses are only for small girls, below the age of 10 or so.  In WM women
riding bicycles or motorscooters by themselves are piloting perhaps 15-20 percent of the two-wheeled
vehicles on the roads, whereas in BB they are almost never seen doing so. Women are also better
represented in the professions in WM--as doctors, professors, lawyers, etc.  "<em>Eve teasing</em>" (the public
abuse of adolescent females by males of the same age, including  verbal harassment, pinching,
punching, etc., but very rarely rape) is a growing pandemic in north India.  In WM, on the other hand,
it seems exceedingly rare. It is just not part of the culture there.

<p>Perhaps the most telling statistics are those for <em>female literacy</em>, as can be seen in Table 2.  The effort
to educate females began in modern times in Maharashtra with Mahatma Phule (see below), but in
terms of literacy things geared up only after the partition.  By 1971 literacy among females in
Maharashtra was getting close to what it was among males in Bihar and Bangladesh.  Ten years later
female literacy in Maharashtra had pulled significantly ahead of the male figures in Bangladesh (which
had even retrogressed somewhat in the 1970s) and was just about even with Bihar in this respect.

<p>3.   There is a <em>tradition of social reform</em> movements in WM, stretching back into the 19th century
if not earlier.  Mahatma Jyotirao Phule was the first of the great social reformers, responsible in large
part for displacing the small Brahman community from their traditional dominance in the Bombay
Presidency and for beginning efforts at uplift of women.  Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, the great Untouchable
leader, is undoubtedly the premier social reformer of the 20th century (today, three decades after his
death), and his statue is probably second or third in popularity in public places.  But there are many
lesser leaders as well.  One way to put this tradition in perspective is to note that it is considered a
worthy and respectable avocation for successful men in their later years to involve themselves in
social uplift activities (or perhaps more important, there seems some social pressure on them to
appear to be doing so, even if in fact they are not).

<p>By contrast, the leading social reformer in Bihar up until quite recently has been Sachchidanand
Sinha, whose great contribution was to lead the movement for a Bihar Province separate from the
Bengal Presidency.  This was "social reform" in a sense, but it was also very much and mainly an
effort to set up a Bihar for his caste brethren the Kayasthas to administer and manage, independent
of the "bhadrolok" Bengalis who had all the good jobs in running  the Bengal Presidency.  Similarly,
the great hero of modern times in Bangladesh is A. K. Fazlul Huq, the "<em>Sher-e-Bangla</em>" ("Tiger of
Bengal"), whose main contribution as perceived today was to establish the political dominance of the
Muslim majority in Bengal during the brief popular governments of the late 1930s, thereby displacing
Hindu control.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> 

<p>In more recent times, of course, there has been Jayaprakash Narayan in Bihar, whose credentials as
a genuine social reformer are very high indeed, while on the other hand Y. B. Chavan made his early
career as a politician by masterminding the bifurcation of Bombay state into present-day Maharashtra
and Gujarat, thereby establishing a state where Marathas could manage things (acting in the name of
Maharashtrians generally, of course).  But these are exceptions, I would argue.  The impulse to social
reform is not unknown in Bihar, but it is certainly rare.  Political opportunism is definitely found in
Maharashtra, and it is more than rare, but it is not so overpoweringly the motif that one finds in BB.

<p><strong><a name="pocu">Political culture</a></strong>

<p>1.  There is a kind of <em>accommodational approach</em> in the politics of Maharashtra that is absent in the
more vicious "winner take all"  politics of BB.   In  Maharashtra political winners are expected to
reserve some share of rewards for losers, or at least to keep the losers working within the system. 
Winners in Congress Party factional struggles do not try to purge losers from all rewards of political
life, for today's losers are expected to stay in the game, maybe even to win later on.  In my time there,
in the second half of 1985, the main political issue of the time centered on Sharad Pawar, a former
chief minister who had left the Congress to form his own party, a group which had lost badly in the
parliamentary and assembly polls earlier.  But instead of trying to eliminate him completely from
political life (which is what the winners would have done in Bihar), the winners in  Maharashtra were
dickering with him on the terms of his readmission to the Congress Party (a move that eventually
occurred in late 1987).  This mellowness no doubt reflects the Congress' leadership's assessment of
Pawar's own real strength, but what is interesting here is the mentality that says "let's make a deal"
rather than "let's liquidate the other side while we can." 

<p>Another example is <em>rural violence</em>. This is hard to measure in any valid way, and knowledgeable
people in both WM and Bihar assert that it has gotten much worse in recent  years, to the point that
the socio-political system is under great strain, perhaps even to the point of siege.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>  Still, the
incidence of Harijan atrocities, <em>goonda</em> terrorism and the like seem to be much greater in rural Bihar
than in Maharashtra.  My impression is that communal violence is also a good deal less severe in
Maharashtra, but I really don't know enough about this to be sure.

<p>2.  The <em>standards of judgment for officeholders</em>.  The ways in which the culture evaluates political
leadership is quite different in the two regions. In  Maharashtra the principal criterion seems to be
<em>performance</em>, with integrity in a strong second place.  It is expected that there will be some
corruption, leakage, lobbying for special interests, nursing of constituencies, etc., but it is also
expected that government must deliver something concrete in promoting rural development (and
development in general, for that matter).  Programs intended to raise agricultural production must
deliver inputs so that they get used to increase irrigation, get fertilizer onto the fields, make credit
available to those who will use it to increase crop production, and so on.  In WM's archetypal
example, the Employment Guarantee Scheme must in fact provide unemployment relief for the rural
poor (though it will also be beneficial to local politicians in the process, there will be some bungling
and embezzling, etc.).

<p>In BB <em>patronage</em> seems the main criterion for judging officeholders.  It isn't really expected that
inputs will ever be used as intended, that irrigation projects will actually deliver much water to
farmers, that roads will be built to handle the traffic load they were designed for, etc.  The first
purpose of government development activity  is to provide patronage and build allegiance for those
who can deliver the patronage.   A second and allied purpose is to maintain the rural gentry's <em>control</em>
over the lower strata at village level by diverting the loot that comes down from higher level to
reinforcing their own positions. 

<p>It probably goes too far to say that the local power structure in BB is <em>hostile</em> to any significant
economic growth on the grounds that such growth might encourage the lower orders to be more
demanding, for there are some (albeit feeble) signs of an agricultural transformation to a market-oriented agriculture going on.  But there is certainly a massive reluctance on the part of the gentry
to seeing any benefits go to the rural poor.   And it is definitely a very long way from rural Bihar to
rural WM in this regard.  To sum up, one could ask:  is an effective EGS even remotely conceivable
in rural Bihar?  To ask such a question, regrettably, is to know the answer.

<p>A good illustration of the difference in standards of judgment of officeholders can be seen in the
resignations of Chief Ministers A. R. Antulay and Shivajirao Patil-Nilangekar in Maharashtra.  Both
were forced out because of corruption scandals aired and publicized in the media -- Antulay in a
cement allocation scam (awarding allocations of this perennially scarce commodity in return for
contributions to a political fund) and Patil-Nilangekar in medical examination fixing scheme (getting
the marks adjusted on the state gynecological exams so that his twice-failed daughter could pass). 
By contrast, at about the same time as Patil-Nilangekar was resigning in Maharashtra, a medical
scandal was emerging in Bihar in which Chief Minister Bindeshwari Dubey was trying to "regularize"
the appointments of (i.e., give permanent civil service status to) the one-third of the state's health
service cadre who had been given their jobs on various ad hoc schemes over the previous eight years. 
Needless to say, more than a few of these appointments had been made on the basis of qualifications
other than medical, but there was no threat to the chief minister on this ground.

<p>Indeed, in Bihar it is inconceivable that a chief minister would be sacked on grounds of corruption
or incompetence.  There have been forced departures and even hints of scandal connected with them,
but the ousters  have  always been mainly concerned with factional intrigues and power bases.  The
most notable example recently has been former chief minister Jagannath Mishra, who has been
strongly implicated in massive corruption at the state fertilizer cooperative.  He was dismissed by
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, but no one interpreted the departure as seriously related to the fertilizer
scandal.  Rather, it was because of factional shifts against Mishra in the Bihar Congress and because
the personal dynamic between Rajiv Gandhi and the Mishra was highly negative (By contrast, Indira
Gandhi, who had a well known "soft corner" for Mishra, kept him in office no matter what the aroma
of misdeeds surrounding him).  Perhaps the best way to put it is to observe that a chief minister in
Bihar would be judged wanting if he were <em>not</em> fiddling with medical exams and cement allocations on
behalf of relatives, caste-fellows and cronies.

<p>4.  <em>The styles of politics</em>.  Politics in Maharashtra is characterized by what might be called a
<em>transactional style</em>, in which people involve themselves in the political arena to exchange benefits. 
Trading and deal-making are the modes of participation.  In BB, the dominant pattern is an <em>allegiant
style</em>.  One plays politics to build up and nurture a support base.  Goods and services do change
hands, but they do so as a means of buying and selling support, whereas in Maharashtra the exchanges
are made with a view to using the goods and services to produce and build things.  Of course there
is a good deal of overlap between the two styles, for transactional politicians need their support bases
too, and the goods and services traded by allegiance-oriented politicians do sometimes serve to
increase economic and/or social productivity.  But in the main, there is a meaningful distinction here. 
The sugar nexus in WM is illustrative of the transactional style, for all the vote-trading, surreptitious
candidate funding and so on really does lead to more investment in rural infrastructure, while in BB,
the horsetrading that goes on is designed to build or destroy patronage empires.

<p>This makes Maharashtra sound more like an idealized Western political system than perhaps it should. 
It is not, after all, pluralist in quite the sense that the US claims to be (though it may have more
resemblance to the US system as it in fact is -- somewhat pluralist but closer to the elite-domination
end of the spectrum).  Furthermore, the EGS is not a panacea for rural poverty.  It may have put a
floor under rural incomes (in contrast to BB, where real income for agricultural labor has fallen in
recent decades as this poor of residual rural labor has grown) and may even have raised rural incomes
slightly, but it has scarcely solved the problems of rural poverty.  But the social/economic/political
infrastructure of Maharashtra has provided a kind of security for the rural poor that is simply nowhere
in sight in BB, and it has also provided an integrated dynamic of rural development that is just not
present in BB. 

<p><center><strong><a name="impl">IV.  Implications for Rural Development Policy</a></strong></center>
<p>In Maharashtra, or certainly WM, the themes of rural development appear to be capitalist agriculture,
cooperative-based politics, interlinked institutional infrastructure to support development and (to a
more modest extent) social responsibility.  In BB, the predominant themes are a semi-feudal
agriculture, a predatory politics reinforced by a functionally diffuse institutional infrastructure and a
lack of social responsibility.  The key difference in terms of rural development strategy would seem
to the emergence of an infrastructure of (more or less) functionally discrete institutions in WM that
do not get sucked into and perverted by the maelstrom of patronage politics but instead can actually
deliver goods and services to promote rural development.  What then might be suggested in the way
of rural development policy to improve things in BB?  

<p>In Bihar there are some indications of an agricultural transformation and the mobilization of a
constituency to support it (with Karpoori Thakur and the Lok Dal being the premier case in point),
but the process is at best slow and seems to have stalled indefinitely after the brief Lok Dal surge to
power in the late 1970s.  Can the momentum be regained, whether with the Lok Dal or with a
reoriented Congress Party that seeks to mobilize "progressive farmer" strata?  There are also signs
of political consciousness and organization among the landless, particularly Harijan groups.  Can they
claim a niche in the political system?  At present, it would appear that any solutions to the dilemmas
of rural stagnation would have to stem out of political action from below -- from the middle and
lower orders breaking into the political arena and forging a place for themselves, from which they
could demand policy and implementational changes that would begin to seriously deliver the goods
for rural development.  Or to put it the other way, there seems virtually no chance of a leadership
emerging at the top with a serious program for developing the state.  If anything, the factional
intercaste and intracaste struggle among the "forwards" that so debilitated the state from the 1950s
through the early 1970s is today even more intense.  This is not the sort of environment to nurture
rural development.

<p>In Bangladesh, on the other hand, there would seem to be more room for maneuver.  Unlike Bihar,
where rural elites with large landholdings tie directly into the upper echelons of state power, in
Bangladesh the dominant elements in the countryside are smaller in scale -- in Bihar they would be
middle peasants, a situation partly due to land pressure fragmenting holdings and partly to the
departure of so many Hindu zamindars after the partition, thereby leaving the field to the smaller fry. 
Thus while the state does need local elites to help maintain order, it is not beholden to them in quite
the same way as in Bihar, for they themselves  do not loom so large as a class on the wider scene of
state politics.

<p>One of the consequences of this relative separation is that the state has somewhat more autonomy
to pursue reformist rural development policies.  Nothing on the order of land reform is in the cards,
to be sure, but the state does have more latitude to tolerate and even modestly support non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that in Bihar would be denounced as unacceptably radical. 
Hence groups like the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) and Proshika can advance
"conscientization" agendas in their rural development work, and have been doing so in some cases
for fifteen years and more.  And quasi-parastatals like the Grameen Bank (that now has several
hundred thousand borrowers) can lend to the rural poor without being taken over by the rural rich. 
Altogether, it is estimated that some 500,000 rural households -- about seven percent of the total --
are covered by one or another of the two hundred or so NGOs now operating in Bangladesh.  By no
means all these NGOs are embarked on agendas like BRAC's or Proshika's, but a good many of them
are, and so far the regime has found them acceptable.

<p>It is also possible to encourage food for work enterprises like those of CARE and the World Food
Programme that are administered with a creditable degree of probity (though the variant on food for
work that is run by the government itself is quite different in this respect).  In recent years there is
even some inferential evidence that rural agricultural wages have gone up,<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> a development which
would have to be due in part to these food for work activities and one which would never be tolerated
in rural Bihar.

<p>The state has also been promoting a decentralization scheme in the form of its upazila parishad
system,<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> in which popularly elected councils for the first time are gaining control of centrally funded
development programs  in their regions.  This effort at present is caught in a sort of pincers, with one
tong representing an effort by the regime to build up a rural power base by decentralization the other
an effort on the part of the bureaucratic cadres to retain their centralized power.  Even to the extent
that the upazila initiative succeeds, it can be seen as an attempt to cement ties between the state and
rural elites, which I would suspect is in large part its intended design.  But the upazila parishads can
also offer a venue for other groups to enter the political arena and become involved, even to take over
with their superior numbers and voting power.  And given the relatively free reign enjoyed by NGOs
in rural Bangladesh, it is more than remotely conceivable that reformist NGOs could mobilize large
segments of the rural poor to mount such a takeover at local level.


<p>Moving into terrain as yet uncharted, it might be possible to organize jute processing and marketing
cooperatives along lines somewhat similar to those pursued by the sugar cooperatives in Maharashtra
(or perhaps similar  to the Anand milk scheme in Gujarat).  Jute is a cash crop that is not consumable
by the growers and which needs considerable processing before it can be sold.  Much of the profit
in the crop is made by the <em>farias</em> or middlemen who buy from the farmers and sell to processors at
higher prices.  The farias could be cut out, cooperative mills could be set up to process the jute into
burlap and carpet backing (the major end products today), and a federation of the processing
cooperatives could market it in the international arena.  There would be some serious difficulties here,
if only because jute has lately faced a declining demand on world markets, but the situation is far from
hopeless.

<p>In short, I believe that there are at least the possibilities there in rural Bangladesh to build the kind
of rural institutional infrastructure and linkages that exist in Maharashtra.  Much will depend on how
the state assesses its opportunities,  how various elites in the system act and react (not least the army,
certainly), and what policies the international donor community pursues.  At best, even a partial
replication of the Maharashtra experience will take a long time, probably longer than the forty years
and more it took in its original setting.  But the potential is there, if not for a restoration of the
"Golden Bengal" of mythical antiquity, at least for a significant improvement over the current scene.

<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>      Needless to say, my indebtedness is enormous, to both institutions and individuals in the United States and South Asia.   Full acknowledgments will have to come later on when the work is
more complete, but for now I would like to thank the American Institute of Indian Studies, the
Fulbright research program, the Social Science Research Council, the Rural Development Committee at Cornell University, and Bucknell University for their support at various stages along the
way.  
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>      I take refuge in this term, which is I believe reasonably accurate, but at the same time sufficiently vague that it is possible to avoid the "mode of production" debate.
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>      The term "state" presents a mild conceptual confusion here, in that for Bihar the government
is a state which is part of a larger central government, whereas in Bangladesh the state is of
course a national government in its own right.  In terms of the rural political economy, however,
the state has virtually the same relationship to the countryside for both cases.  The maintenance of
state power today means continuation of a  Congress ministry in Patna and of the Ershad regime
in Dhaka. 
<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>      It is more difficult to deal with regions in Maharashtra than for Bihar and Bangladesh, in
large part because while the latter have been more or less identifiable since the division of the
Bengal presidency in 1912 (and in many ways date back long before that), Maharashtra is a much
more recent creation, having been formed in its present shape only in 1960.  The focus of this paper is on the western Deccan lava of Maharashtra that is the major sugar producing area of the
state; this consists of the Pune division's six districts plus three from Bombay division (Nashik,
Dhule and Jalgaon), or altogether nine of the state's present 27 districts, which are collectively
often called Western Maharashtra.  All of the nine save Kolhapur and a portion of Sangli districts
(which were  former princely states) were part of the Bombay presidency during the British period, thus giving them a common history not shared by the Marathwada and Vidharbha regions to
their east.  For Bihar I should note that the present analysis applies basically to the Gangetic plain
region of the state, not to the largely tribal area of Chotanagpur. 
<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a>      Even gur-making is too complex to be done at home.  The process requires an investment of
several thousand dollars and perhaps a dozen or more employees working at any one time.
<p><a name="N_6_">6. </a>      Some perspective here might be gained from reflecting on the awesomely high subsidies given to water supplied in the western United States by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
<p><a name="N_7_">7. </a>      Much of the irrigation in WM is through gravity flow channels that do not require pumps, but
a good part comes from wells, which are charged primarily through underground percolation from
unlined channels which leak a good deal of their water into the adjacent soil.  For farmers benefiting from this indirect water supply, electricity for pumps is a major consideration. 
<p><a name="N_8_">8. </a>      In the summer of 1987, for example, the world price of sugar was about US 6&#162;/lb., while inside India it was the equivalent of around US 25&#162;.  At times, of course, the world price might be
in excess of the internal Indian price, but in recent years the international price has tended to stay
quite low.
<p><a name="N_9_">9. </a>      There are other programs patterned on EGS that have been initiated in recent years by the
center, in particular the Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Scheme and the National Rural
Employment Programme, but neither thus far is more than a pale imitation of the original.
<p><a name="N_10_">10. </a>      Buying these would-be "progressive farmers" off for the Congress would presumably mean
providing them with some of the inputs and technologies that their counterparts elsewhere in India
have been getting for years and even decades from the government, so such "bribery" is another
way of saying instrumental development-oriented politics.  And indeed such a politics might lead
to a significant degree of development in Bihar, were it not for the huge dead weight of the upper
gentry castes controlling the overall direction of political life there.
<p><a name="N_11_">11. </a>      Altogether the various food for work programs in Bangladesh are estimated to generate upwards of 70 million work days annually.
<p><a name="N_12_">12. </a>      That effect has been uneven, with those better off getting a larger share, but then what place
outside of  China in the Cultural Revolution has not?  The point is that those in the lower income
deciles have been getting something tangible from the rural development process, whereas in BB
this has evidently not been the case.
<p><a name="N_13_">13. </a>      Reconstructing the present area of Maharashtra from compilations of the British period is a
tedious task, for it involves adding in and subtracting out a number of districts from different British provinces as well as a large group of princely states.  Bihar and Bangladesh are a great deal
easier to deal with in this respect.
<p><a name="N_14_">14. </a>      To some extent these observations may be more revealing of north-south (or Aryan-Dravidian) differences in India than east-west divisions.
<p><a name="N_15_">15. </a>      Ironically, Huq himself devoted much of his energy to keeping Hindus and Muslims united,
but that is not what he is remembered for.
<p><a name="N_16_">16. </a>      Interestingly, rural violence, though far from absent in Bangladesh, appears much attenuated
over what it was in the early 1970s, when the well-armed remnants of various freedom fighter
groups roamed the countryside.
<p><a name="N_17_">17. </a>      Recent World Bank data show a 2.4% annual increase in real rural wages over the 1979-1986 period,  a rather startling development after the steady downward trend during the 1970s. 
Studies by other donors indicate similar trends.  Personally, I must confess some skepticism here,
for the news seems too good to make sense, in view of what is known about the relative increases
in the labor force and available employment.
<p><a name="N_18_">18. </a>      Upazilas ("next to district" in Bengali) are the old thanas (analogous to tehsils, talukas,
anchals or blocks in those areas of India outside the old Bengal Presidency).<p>
